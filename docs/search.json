There should be no riskless profit to be gained by a combination of a forward contract position with positions in other assets.\nThis principle assumes that (1) transactions costs are zero, (2) there are no restrictions on short sales or the use of short sale proceeds, and (3) both borrowing and lending can be done in unlimited amounts at the risk-free rate of interest.\nForward price = price that prevents profitable riskless arbitrage in frictionless markets"

Thus, the margin in the futures markets is a performance guarantee.\nMarking to market is the process of adjusting the margin balance in a futures account each day for the change in the value of the contract from the previous trading day, based on the settlement price.\nLike forward contracts, futures contracts have no value at contract initiation. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts do not accumulate value changes over the term of the contract. Since futures accounts are marked to market daily, the value after the margin deposit has been adjusted for the day’s gains and losses in contract value is always zero."

While the intrinsic value can be invested at the risk-free rate, the interest so earned is less than the time value in most cases. For deep-in-the-money put option, the upside is limited. In such cases, the interest on intrinsic value can exceed the option’s time value.\nAmerican-style call options on dividend-paying stocks can be evaluated similarly.
