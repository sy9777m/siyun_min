    "text": "The “bid-offer” spread is also known as the “bid-ask” spread.\n\n\na quote of 1.4126 USD/EUR means that each euro costs $1.4126. The euro is called the base currency and the USD the price currency.\n\n\n\nimage-20211021195336133\n\n\nA spot exchange rate is the currency exchange rate for immediate delivery, which for most currencies means the exchange of currencies takes place two days after the trade (2 business days). A forward exchange is a currency exchange rate for an exchange to be done in the future. Forward rates are quoted for various future dates.\n1 month = 30 days in foreign exchange\nDealer quotes often include both bid and offer (ask) rates. For example, the euro could be quoted as $1.4124 - $1.4128. The bid price ($1.4124) is price at which the dealer will buy euros, and the offer price ($1.4128) is the price at which the dealer will sell euros.\n\n\n\nThe difference between the offer and bid price is called the spread. Spread are often stated as ‘pips’. One pip is 1/10,000. Dealers manage their foreign currency inventories by transacting in the interbank market (think of this as a wholesale market for currency). Spread are narrow in the interbank market.\nThe spread quoted by a dealer depends on:\n\nThe spread in an interbank market for the same currency pair. - Dealer spreads vary directly with spreads quoted in the interbank market.\nThe size of transaction. - Larger, liquidity-demanding transactions generally get quoted a larger spread.\nThe relationship between the dealer and client. - Sometimes, dealer will give favorable rates to preferred clients based on other ongoing business relationships.\n\nThe interbank spread on a currency pair depends on:\n\nCurrencies involved - Similar to stocks, high-volume currency pairs command lower spreads than do lower-volume currency pairs.\nTime of day - The time overlap during the trading day when both the New York and London currency markets are open is considered the most liquidity time window; spreads are narrower during this period than at other times of the day.\nMarket volatility - Spreads are directly related to the exchange rate volatility of the currencies involved. Higher volatility leads to higher spreads to compensate market makers for the increased risk of holding those currencies.\n\nIn addition to these factors, spreads in forward exchange rate quotes increases with maturity. The reasons for this are: longer maturity contracts tend to be less liquid, counterparty credit risk in forward contracts increases with maturity, and interest rate risk in forward contracts increases with maturity.\n\n\n\nBuy the base currency at ask, and sell the base currency at bid\nBu the price currency at bid, and sell the price currency at ask\nup-the-bid-and-multiply, down-the-ask-and-divide rule\n\n\n\nimage-20211021200556985\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211021200603432\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211021200643474\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211021200635872\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211021200704736\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211021200719992\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211021200727698\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForward premium - if the forward price (in units of the second currency) is greater than the spot price.\nForward discount - if the forward price (in units of the second currency) is less than the spot price. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{forward\\, premium\\, (discount)} = F - S_{0}\n\\] Given a quote of A/B, if the above equation results in a positive value, we say that currency B is trading at a premium in the forward market.\n\n\n\nimage-20211022024433366\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022024447525\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe value of a forward currency contract prior to expiration is also known as the mark-to-market value. \\[\n\\\\\\text{long position}\n\\\\V_{t} = \\frac{(FP_{t} - FP)(\\operatorname{contract size})}{1 + R\\frac{days}{360}}\n\\\\FP_{t} = \\text{forward price (to sell base currency) at time t in the market for a new contract maturing at time T}\n\\\\FP = \\text{forward price specified in the contract at inception (to buy the base currency)}\n\\] \n\n\n\nimage-20211022024801807\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovered interest rate parity holds when any forward premium or discount exactly offsets differences in interest rates, so that an investor would earn the same return investing in either currency. If euro interest rates are higher than dollar interest rates, the forward discount on the euro relative to the dollar will just offset the higher euro interest rate.\n \\[\n\\\\F = \\frac{1 + R_{A}\\frac{days}{360}}{1 + R_{B}\\frac{days}{360}}S_{0}\n\\]  \\[\n\\\\\\text{forward premium (discount)} = F - S_{0} = [\\frac{1 + R_{A}\\frac{days}{360}}{1 + R_{B}\\frac{days}{360}} - 1]S_{0}\n\\] \n\n\n\nimage-20211022025307548\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022025316269\n\n\n\n\n\nIf forward currency contracts are not available, or if capital flows are restricted so as to prevent arbitrage, the relationship need not hold. Uncovered interest parity refers to such a situation; \\[\n\\\\E(\\%\\Delta{S})_{A/B} = R_{A} - R_{B}\n\\] \n\n\n\nimage-20211022025448953\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022025454793\n\n\nAn investor that choose to invest in the foreign currency without any additional return (the interest rate differential is offset by currency value changes) is not demanding a risk premium for the foreign currency risk. Hence, uncovered interest rate parity assume that the investor is risk-neutral.\nIf the forward rate is equal to the expected future spot rate, we say that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. In such an instance, \\(F = E(S_{1})\\); this is called forward rate parity. In this special case, if covered interest parity holds (and it will; by arbitrage) uncovered interest parity would also hold (and vice versa).\nThere is no reason that uncovered interest rate parity must hold in the short run, and indeed it typically does not. There is evidence that it does generally hold in the long run, so longer-term expected future spot rates based on uncovered interest rate parity are often used as forecasts of future exchange rates.\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\R_{nominal} = R_{real} + E(Inflation)\n\\\\(1 + R) = (1 + r)(1 + i_{e})\n\\]\n\n\n\nUnder real interest rate parity, real interest rates are assumed to converge across different markets. Taking the Fisher relation and real interest rate parity together gives us the international Fisher effect. \\[\n\\\\R_{nominal\\, A} - R_{nominal\\, B} = E(inflation_{A}) - E(inflation_{B})\n\\] The argument for the equality of real interest rates across countries is based on the idea that with free capital flows, funds will move to the country with a higher real rate until real rates are equalized.\n\n\n\nThe law of one price states that identical goods should have the same price in all locations.\nHowever, that the law of one price does not hold in practice, due to the effects of frictions such as tariffs and transportation costs.\nInstead of focusing on individual products, absolute purchasing power parity (absolute PPP) compares the average price of a representative basket of consumption goods between countries. Absolute PPP requires only that the law of one price be correct on average, that is, for like baskets of goods in each country. \\[\n\\\\S(A/B) = CPI(A) / CPI(B)\n\\] In practice, even if the law of one price held for every good in two economies, absolute PPP might not hold because the weights (consumption patterns) of the various goods in the two economies may not be the same.\n\n\n\nRelative purchasing power parity (relative PPP) states that changes in exchange rates should exactly offset the price effects of any inflation differential between two countries. \\[\n\\\\\\%\\Delta{S_{A/B}} = Inflation_{A} - Inflation_{B}\n\\] \n\n\n\nThe ex-ante version of purchasing power parity is the same as relative purchasing power parity except that it uses expected inflation instead of actual inflation.\nBecause there is no true arbitrage available to force relative PPP to hold, violations of relative PPP in the short run are common. However, because the evidence suggests that the relative form of PPP holds approximately in the long run, it remains a useful method for estimating the relationship between exchange rates and inflation rates.\n환율예측모형\n\n\n\nimage-20211022062201634\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022062215873\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCovered interest parity holds by arbitrage. If forward rate parity holds, uncovered interest rate parity also holds (and vice versa). - Forward rate parity \\(F = E(S)\\)\nInterest rate differentials should mirror inflation differentials. This holds true if the international Fisher relation holds. If that is true, we can also use inflation differentials to forecast future exchange rates-which is the premise of the ex-ante version of PPP. - Real interest rate parity \\(r_{Y} = r_{X}\\)\nIf the ex-ante version of relative PPP as well as the international Fisher relation both hold, uncovered interest rate parity will also hold.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022062252136\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf uncovered IRP does not hold\nUncovered interest rate parity states that a currency with a high interest rate should depreciated relative to a currency with a lower interest rate, so that an investor would earn the same return investing in either currency.\nIn a FX carry trade, an investor invests in a higher yielding currency using funds borrowed in a lower yielding currency. The lower yielding currency is called the funding currency.\nThe FX carry trade attempts to capture an interest rate differential and is a bet against uncovered interest rate parity. Carry trades typically perform well during low-volatility periods. Sometimes, higher yields attract larger capital flows, which in turn lead to an economic boom and appreciation (instead of depreciation) of the higher yielding currency. This could make the carry trade even more profitable, because the investor earns a return from currency appreciation in addition to the return from the interest rate spread.\n\n\n\nThe risk is the funding currency may appreciate significantly against the currency of the investment, which would reduce a trader’s profit-or even lead to a loss. Furthermore, the return distribution of the carry trade is not normal; it is characterized by negative skewness and excess kurtosis (i.e., fat tails), meaning that the probability of a large loss is higher than the probability implied under a normal distribution. We call this high probability of a large loss the crash risk of the carry trade.\nAs more investors follow and adopt the same strategy, the demand for high-yielding currency actually pushes it value up. However, with this herding behavior comes the risk that all investors may attempt to exit the trade at the same time. (This is especially true if investors use stop-loss orders in their carry trade.) During turbulent times, as investors exit their positions (i.e., a flight to safety), the high-yielding currency can experience a steep decline in value, generating large losses for traders pursuing FX carry trades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022062322338\n\n\n\n\nBalance-of-payments accounting is a method used to keep track of transactions between a country and its international trading partners.\nThe current account measure the exchange of goods, the exchange of services, the exchange of investment income, and unilateral transfers (gifts to and from other nations).\nThe financial account (also known as the capital account) measures the flow of funds for debt and equity investment into and out of the country.\nWhen a country experiences a current account deficit, it must generate a surplus in its capital account (or see its currency depreciate). Capital flows tend to be the dominant factor influencing exchange rates in the short term, as capital flows tend to be larger and more rapidly changing than goods flows.\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent account deficits lead to a depreciation of domestic currency via a variety of mechanisms:\n\nFlow supply / demand mechanisms - Current account deficits in a country increase the supply of that currency in the market (As exporters to that country convert their revenues into their own local currency). This puts downward pressure on the exchange value of that currency. The decrease in the value of the currency may restore the current account deficit to a balance-depending on the following factors:\n\nThe initial deficit - The larger the initial deficit, the larger the depreciation of domestic currency needed to restore current account balance.\nThe influence of exchange rates on domestic import and export prices - As a country’s current depreciates, the cost of imported goods increase. However, some of the increase in cost may not be passed on to consumers.\nPrice elasticity of demand of the traded goods - If the most important imports are relatively price inelastic, the quantity imported will not change.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022032755373\n\n\n\nPortfolio balance mechanism - Countries with current account surpluses usually have capital account deficits, which typically take the form of investments in countries with current account deficits. As a result of these flows of capital, investor countries may find their portfolios’ composition being dominated by few investee currencies. When investor countries decide to rebalance their investment portfolios, it can have a significant negative impact on the value of those investee country currencies.\nDebt sustainability mechanism - A country running a current account deficit may be running a capital account surplus by borrowing from abroad. When the level of debt gets too high relative to GDP, investors may question the sustainability of this level of debt, leading to a rapid depreciation of the borrower’s currency.\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital account flows are one of the major determinants of exchange rates. As capital flows into a country, demand for that country’s currency increase, resulting in appreciation.\nExcessive capital inflows into emerging markets create problems for those countries such as:\n\nExcessive real appreciation of the domestic currency.\nFinancial asset and / or real estate bubbles.\nIncreases in external debt by businesses or government.\nExcessive consumption in the domestic market fueled by credit.\n\nEmerging market government often counteract excessive capital inflows by imposing capital controls or by direct intervention in the foreign exchange markets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022062338751\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpansionary monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy are likely to have opposite effects on exchange rates.\n\n\n\nimage-20211022033436603\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022033448969\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022033523985\n\n\nAn expansionary (restrictive) monetary policy would lead to depreciation (appreciation) of the domestic currency as stated previously. Under a fixed rate regime, the government would then have to purchase (sell) its own currency in the foreign exchange market. This action essentially reverses the expansionary (restrictive) stance.\n\n\n\nMonetary models only take into account the effect of monetary policy on exchange rates (fiscal policy effects are not considered). With the Mundell-Fleming model, we assume that inflation (price levels) play no role in exchange rate determination. Under monetary models, we assume that output is fixed, so that monetary policy primarily affects inflation, which in turn affects exchange rates.\n\nPure monetary model - Therefore an x% increase in the money supply leads to an x% increase in price levels and then to an x% depreciation of domestic currency.\nDornbusch overshooting model - This model assumes that prices are sticky (inflexible) in the short term and, hence, do not immediately reflect changes in monetary policy (in other words, PPP does not hold in the short term). The model concludes that exchange rates will overshoot the long-run PPP value in the short term. In the case of expansionary monetary policy, prices increase, but over time. Expansionary monetary policy leads to a decrease in interest rates-and a larger-than-PPP-implied depreciation of the domestic currency due to capital outflows. In the long term, exchange rates gradually increase toward their PPP implied values.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022034120321\n\n\n\n\n\nThe portfolio balance approach focuses only on the effects of fiscal policy (and not monetary policy). While the Mundell-Fleming model focuses on the short-term implication of fiscal policy, the portfolio balance approach takes a long-term view and evaluates the effects of a sustainable fiscal deficit or surplus on currency values.\nCombining the Mundell-Fleming and portfolio balance approaches, we find that in the short term, with free capital flows, an expansionary fiscal policy leads to domestic currency appreciation (via high interest rates). In the long term, the government has to reverse course (through tighter fiscal policy) leading to depreciation of the domestic currency. If the government does not reverse course, it will have to monetize its debt, which would also lead to depreciation of the domestic currency.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe objectives of capital controls or central bank intervention in FX markets are to:\n\nEnsure that the domestic currency does not appreciate excessively.\nAllow the pursuit of independent monetary policies without being hindered by their impact on currency value.\nReduce the aggregate volume of inflow of foreign capital.\n\n\n\n\nFor developed market countries, the volume of trading in a country’s currency is usually very large relative to the foreign exchange reserves of it central bank. Evidence has shown that for developed markets, central banks are relatively ineffective at intervening in the foreign exchange markets due to lack of sufficient resources. Evidence in the case of emerging markets is less clear: central banks of emerging market countries may be able to accumulate sufficient foreign exchange reserves (relative to trading volume) to affect the supply and demand of their currencies in the foreign exchange markets.\n\n\n\n\nThe following conditions have been identified as warning signs in the period leading up to a currency crisis:\n\nTerms of trade (i.e., ratio of exports to imports) deteriorate\nFixed or partially-fixed exchange rates (versus floating exchange rates)\nOfficial foreign exchange reserves dramatically decline\nCurrency value that has risen above its historical mean\nInflation increases\nLiberalized capital markets, that allows for the free flow of capital\nMoney supply relative to bank reserves increases\nBanking crises (may also be coincident)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022062357431\n\n\nA country’s standard of living, however, is best measured by GDP per capita.\n\n\n\nSavings and investment - If a country has insufficient domestic savings, it must attract foreign investment in order to grow.\nFinancial markets and intermediaries\nPolitical stability, rule of law, and property rights\nInvestment in human capital - Consequently, countries that invest in education and health care systems tend to have higher growth rates. Developed countries benefit the most from post-secondary education spending, which has been shown to foster innovation. Less-developed countries benefit the most from spending on primary and secondary education, which enables the workforce to apply the technology developed elsewhere.\nTax and regulatory systems - Lower levels of regulation foster entrepreneurial activity (startups), which have been shown to be positively related to the overall level of productivity.\nFree trade and unrestricted capital flows\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand this, consider that the growth in aggregate stock market valuation is a function of GDP growth, growth in earnings relative to GDP, and growth in the price to earing ratio: \\[\n\\\\\\Delta{P} = \\Delta{GDP} + \\Delta{(E/GDP)} + \\Delta{(P/E)}\n\\\\\\text{long term: } \\Delta{(E/GDP)} = \\Delta{(P/E)} = 0\n\\] Over the long-term, we have to recognize that growth in earnings relative to GDP is zero; growth in the P/E ratio will also be zero over the long term; Hence over a sufficiently long time horizon, the potential GDP growth rate equals the growth rate of aggregate equity valuation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022040003130\n\n\nPositive growth in potential GDP indicates that future income will rise relative to current income. When consumers expect their incomes to rise, they increase current consumption and save less for future consumption (i.e., they are less likely to worry about funding their future consumption). To encourage consumers to delay consumption (i.e., to encourage savings), investments would have to offer a higher real rate of return. Therefore, higher potential GDP growth implies higher interest rates and higher real estate returns in general.\nIn the short term, the relationship between actual GDP and potential GDP may provide insight to both equity and fixed-income investors as to the state of the economy. For example, since actual GDP in excess of potential GDP results in rising prices, the gap between the two can be used as a forecast of inflationary pressures-useful to all investors but of particular concern to fixed-income investors. Furthermore, central banks are likely to adopt monetary policies consistent with the gap between potential output and actual output. When actual GPD growth rate is higher (lower) than potential GDP growth rate, concerns about inflation increase (decrease) and the central bank is more likely to follow restrictive (expansionary) monetary policy.\n\n\n\n\n\nOutput (Y) is a function of labor (L) and capital (K), given a level of technology (T)\nCapital investment on economic growth and labor productivity, consider a Cobb-Douglas production function which takes the form: \\[\n\\\\Y = TK^{\\alpha}L^{1 - \\alpha}\n\\\\\\alpha\\, and (1 - \\alpha) = \\text{the share of output allocated to capital (K) and labor (L), respectively } [\\alpha\\, and (1 - \\alpha) \\text{ are also referred to as capital's and labor's share of total factor cost, where } \\alpha < 1]\n\\\\T = \\text{a scale factor that represents that technological progress of the economy, often referred to as total factor productivity (TFP)}\n\\] \nThe Cobb-Douglas function essentially states that output (GDP) is a function of labor and capital inputs and their productivity. It exhibits constant returns of scale; increasing both inputs by a fixed percentage leads to the same percentage increase in output.\nDividing both sides by L in the Cobb-Douglas production function, we can obtain the output per worker (labor productivity). \\[\n\\\\\\text{output per worker} = Y / L = T(K / L)^{\\alpha}\n\\] Labor productivity is similar to GDP per capital, a standard of living measure. Assuming the number of workers and \\(\\alpha\\) remain constant, increasing in output can be gained by increasing capital per worker (capital deepening) or by improving technology (increasing TFP).\n\n\n\nimage-20211022050248516\n\n\nHowever, since \\(\\alpha\\) is less than one, additional capital has a diminishing effect on productivity: the lower the value of \\(\\alpha\\), the lower the benefit of capital deepening. Developed markets typically have a high capital to labor ratio and a lower \\(\\alpha\\) compared to developing markets, and therefore developed markets stand to gain less in increased productivity from capital deepening.\nIn stead state (i.e., equilibrium), the marginal product of capital (MPK = \\(\\alpha\\)Y/K) and marginal cost of capital (i.e., the rental price of capital, r) are equal; hence: \\[\n\\\\\\alpha Y / K = r\n\\\\\\alpha = r K / Y\n\\\\MPK = \\frac{dY}{dK} = \\alpha T K^{\\alpha - 1} L^{1 - \\alpha} = \\frac{\\alpha T K^{\\alpha} L^{1 - \\alpha}}{K} = \\frac{\\alpha Y}{K}\n\\] Economies will increase investment in capital as long as MPK > r. At the level of K / L for which MPK = r, capital deepening stops and labor productivity becomes stangnant.\n \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{labor productivity growth rate} = \\operatorname{growth due to technological change} + \\operatorname{growth due to capital deepening}\n\\\\\\frac{\\Delta{Y}}{Y} = \\frac{\\Delta{T}}{T} + \\alpha\\frac{\\Delta{K}}{K} + (1 - \\alpha)\\frac{\\Delta{L}}{L}\n\\\\(y = \\frac{Y}{L}, k = \\frac{K}{L})\n\\\\y = TK^{\\alpha}\n\\\\\\frac{\\Delta{y}}{y} = \\frac{\\Delta{T}}{T} + \\alpha\\frac{\\Delta{K}}{K}\n\\] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\Delta{Y}/Y = \\Delta{A} / A + \\alpha * \\Delta{K} / K + (1 - \\alpha) * \\Delta{L} / L\n\\\\A = \\text{technology}\n\\\\\\alpha = \\text{elasticity of output with respect to capital} = \\text{share of income paid to capital}\n\\\\(1 - \\alpha) = \\text{elasticity of output with respect to labor} = \\text{share of income paid to labor}\n\\\\\\text{growth rate in potential GDP} = \\text{long-term growth rate of technology} + \\alpha (\\text{long-term growth rate of capital}) + (1 - \\alpha) (\\text{long-term growth rate of labor})\n\\]\nAnother approach to forecasting potential GDP growth is the labor productivity growth accounting equation, which focuses on changes in labor as follows: \\[\n\\\\\\text{growth rate in potential GDP} = \\text{long-term growth rate of labor force} + \\text{long-term growth rate in labor productivity}\n\\\\\\frac{\\Delta{y}}{y} = \\frac{\\Delta{Y}}{Y} - \\frac{\\Delta{L}}{L}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nNatural resources include both renewable resources, such as timber, and non-renewable resources, such as oil and gas.\nOne reason that limited natural resources do not necessarily constrain economic growth is that access to natural resources does not require ownership of resources.\nThe so-called “Dutch disease” refers to a situation where global demand for a country’s natural resources drives up the country’s currency values, making all exports more expensive and rendering other domestic industries uncompetitive in the global markets.\n\n\n\nAn increase in the quantity of labor will increase output, but not per capital output. Labor force is defined as the number of working age (ages 16-64) people available to work, both employed and unemployed.\n\n\n\nDemographics - Countries with younger population have higher potential growth.\nLabor force participation \\[\n\\\\\\text{labor force participation} = \\frac{\\text{labor force}}{\\text{working age population}}\n\\] Labor force participation can increase as more women enter the workforce.\nImmigration - Immigration poses a potential solution to declining labor force. Countries with low population growth or adverse demographic shifts (older population) may find their growth constrained. Since developed countries tend to have lower fertility rates than less developed countries, immigration represents a potential source of continued economic growth in developed countries.\nAverage hours worked - For most countries, the general trend in average hours worked in downward. Possible explanations include legislation limiting the number of hours worked, the “wealth effect” which includes individuals to take more leisure time, high tax rates on labor income, and an increase in part-time and temporary workers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman capital is knowledge and skills individual possess.\n\n\n\nPhysical capital is generally separated into infrastructure, computers, and telecommunication capital (ICT) and non-ICT capital (i.e., machinery, transportation, and non-residential construction). Empirical research has found a strong correlation between investment in physical capital and GDP growth rates.\nThis result may seen inconsistent given our previous discussion about capital deepening and diminishing marginal returns to capital. First, many countries (e.g., developing economies have relatively low capital to labor ratios, so increases in capital may still have significant impact on economic growth. Second, capital investment can take different forms. Some capital investment actually influence technological progress, thereby increasing TFP and economic growth. For example, acceleration of spending in the IT sector has created what are termed network externalities. Investment in IT networks may have multiplicative effects on productivity since IT network investment actually becomes more valuable as more people are connected to the network.\n\n\n\nResearchers have examined proxies for investment in technology such as research and development (R&D) spending or number of patents issued.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBased on Malthusian economics, classical growth theory posits that, in the long-term, population growth increases whenever there are increases in per capita income above subsistence level due to an increase in capital or technological progress. Subsistence level is the minimum income needed to maintain life. Classical growth theory contends that growth in real GDP per capita is not permanent, because when real GDP per capita rises above the subsistence level, a population explosion occurs. Population growth leads to diminishing marginal returns to labor, which reduces productivity and drives GDP per capita back to the subsistence level. This mechanism would prevent long-term growth in per capita income. Classical growth theory is not supported by empirical evidence.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022062446187\n\n\nNeoclassical growth theory’s primary focus is on estimating the economy’s long-term steady state growth rate (sustainable growth rate or equilibrium growth rate). The economy is at equilibrium when the output-to-capital ratio is constant. Under neoclassical theory, population growth is independent of economic growth.\n\nSustainable growth of output per capita (or output per worker)(\\(g^{*}\\)) is equal to the growth rate in technology (\\(\\theta\\)) divided by labor’s share of GDP (\\(1 - \\alpha\\)) \\[\n\\\\g^{*} = \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\alpha}\n\\]\nSustainable growth rate of output (\\(G^{*}\\)) is equal to the sustainable growth rate of output per capita, plus the growth of labor (\\(\\Delta{L}\\)). \\[\n\\\\G^{*} = \\frac{\\theta}{1 - \\alpha} + \\Delta{L}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211022053626358\n\n\nUnder neoclassical theory:\n\nCapital deepening affects the level of output but not the growth rate in the long run. Capital deepening may temporarily increase the growth rate, but the growth rate will revert back to the sustainable level if there is no technological progress.\nAn economy’s growth rate will move towards its steady state regardless of the initial capital to labor ratio or level of technology.\nIn the steady state, the growth rate in productivity is a function only of the growth rate of technology and labor’s share of total output.\nIn the steady state, marginal product of capital (MPK) = \\(\\alpha\\) Y / K is constant, but marginal productivity is diminishing.\nAn increase in savings will only temporarily raise economic growth. However, countries with higher savings rates will enjoy higher capital to labor ratio and higher productivity.\nDeveloping countries (with a lower level of capital per worker) will be impacted less by diminishing marginal productivity of capital, and hence have higher growth rates as compared to developed countries; there will be eventual convergence of per capita incomes.\n\n\n\n\nEndogenous growth theory contends that technological growth emerges as a result of investment in both physical and human capital (hence the name endogenous which means coming from within). Technological progress enhances productivity of both labor and capital. Unlike the neoclassical model, there is no steady state growth rate, so that increased investment can permanently increase the rate of growth.\nIncreasing R&D investments, for example, results in benefits that also external to the firm making the R&D investments. Those benefits raise the level of growth for the entire economy.\nThe endogenous growth model theorize that returns to capital are constant. The endogenous growth model implies that an increase in savings will permanently increase the growth rate.\nEndogenous growth theory, on the other hand, assumes that capital investment (R&D expenditures) may actually improve total factor productivity.\n\n\n\n\nThe absolute convergence hypothesis states that less developed countries will achieve equal living standards over time. The conditional convergence hypothesis states that convergence in living standards will only occur for countries with the same savings rates, population growth rates, and production functions. Under the conditional convergence hypothesis, the growth rate will be higher for less developed countries until they catch up. Under the neoclassical model, once a developing country’s standard of living converges with that of developed countries, the growth rate will then stabilize to the same steady state growth rate as that of developed countries.\nClub convergence. Under this hypothesis, countries may be part of a ‘club’ (i.e., countries with similar institutional features such as savings rates, financial markets, property rights, health and educational services, etc.). Under club convergence, pooper countries that are part of the club will grow rapidly to catch up with their richer peers. Countries can ‘join’ the club by making appropriate institutional changes. Those countries that are not part of the club may never achieve the higher standard of living.\n\n\n\nUnder endogenous growth theory, private sector investments in R&D and knowledge capital benefit the society overall. The effects of ‘social returns’ of externalities are captured in the endogenous growth theory model, which concludes that economies may not reach a steady state growth but may permanently increase growth by expenditures that provide both benefits to the company (private benefits) and benefits to society (externalities).\n\n\n\nRemoving trade barriers and allowing for free flow of capital is likely to have the following benefits for countries:\n\nIncreased investment from foreign savings\nAllows focus on industries where the country has a comparative advantage\nIncreased markets for domestic products, resulting in economies of scale\nIncreased sharing of technology and higher total factor productivity growth\nIncreased competition leading to failure of inefficient firms and reallocation of their assets to more efficient uses\n\nThe neoclassical model’s predictions in an open economy (i.e., an economy without any barriers to trade or capital flow) focus on the convergence. Since developing economies have not reached the point of significant diminishing returns on capital, they can attract capital through foreign investment and experience productivity growth as a result. Eventually, these economies will develop; their growth will slow and will converge to the steady state growth rate of developed economies.\nThe endogenous growth model also predicts greater growth with free trade and high mobility of capital since open markets foster increased innovation. As foreign competition increases, more efficient and innovation firms will survive. Those firms permanently increase the growth rate of the international economy by providing benefits beyond those simply captured by the firm. Economies of scale also increase output as firms serve larger markets and become more efficient.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulations are often required when markets cannot provide efficient solutions (also known as Pareto optimal, which means that one cannot make any participant better off without making some other participant worse off) for all problems.\nInformational frictions - information asymmetry\n\n\n\nimage-20211022055838539\n\n\nExternalities are costs or benefits that affect a party that did not choose to incur that cost or benefit.\nWeak competition can lead to fewer choices, higher prices, and lack of innovation. Antitrust regulations seek to mitigate this problem.\nSocial objectives are achieved via provision of public goods. A public good is a resource that can be enjoyed by a person without making it unavailable to others.\n\n\n\nimage-20211022060018319\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRegulating commerce\nRegulating financial markets - The objectives of securities regulations include three interrelated goals: protect investors, create confidence in the markets, and enhance capital formation.\n\n\n\n\nDisclosure requirements\nRegulations imposing fiduciary duties seek to mitigate such agency problems.\nRegulations have historically focused on protecting small (retail) investors.\n\n\n\n\nPrudential supervision refers to the monitoring and regulation of financial institutions to reduce system-wide risks to protect investors. Prudential supervision is important because the failure of one financial institution can have a far-reaching impact and may result in a loss of confidence.\n\n\n\n\nAntitrust regulation\n\n\n\nStatutes - laws made by legislative bodies\nAdministrative regulations - rules issued by government agencies or other bodies authorized by the government\nJudicial law - findings of the court\n\n\nRegulators can be government agencies or independent regulators. Independent regulators are given recognition by government agencies and have power to make rules and enforce them. However, independent regulators are usually not funded by the government and hence are politically independent.\nIndustry self-regulatory bodies (SRBs) are private organization that represent as well as regulate their members. Members of SRBs have to adhere to its rules. SRBs nonetheless are attractive in that they increase the overall level of regulatory resources, utilize the industry professionals with the requisite expertise, and allow regulators to devote resources to other priorities.\nSRBs that are recognized by the government and given enforcement powers are self-regulating organizations (SROs). SROs are also independently funded and, as such, are politically independent. SROs regulate the behavior of their members and often provide public goods in the form of standards. Because of their recognition by the government, SROs fall within the category of independent regulators.\nOutside bodies are not regulators themselves, but their product is referenced by regulators. Examples of outside bodies include FASB and IASB.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regulatory capture is based upon the assumption that, regardless of the original purpose behind its establishment, a regulatory body will, at some point in time, be influenced or even possibly controlled by the industry that is being regulated. The rationale behind the theory is that regulators often have experience in the industry, and this affects the regulators’ ability to render impartial decisions.\nRegulatory differences between jurisdictions can lead to regulatory competition, in which regulators compete to provide the most business-friendly regulatory environment. Regulatory arbitrage occurs when businesses shop for a country that allows a specific behavior rather than changing the behavior. Regulatory arbitrage also entails exploiting the difference between the economic substance and interpretation of a regulation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice mechanisms - Price mechanisms such as taxes and subsidies can be used to further specific regulatory objectives; for example, sin taxes are often used to deter consumption of alcohol.\nRestricting or requiring certain activities - Regulators may ban certain activities or require that certain activities be performed to further their objectives.\nProvision of public goods or financing of private projects - Regulators may provide public goods or fund private projects depending on their political priorities and objectives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe costs and benefits of regulations may be easy to view but difficult to quantify. An analyst should also consider the cost of the regulation to the private sector.\nRegulatory burden (also known as government burden) refers to the cost of compliance for the regulated entity. Regulatory burden minus the private benefits of regulation is known as the net regulatory burden.\nRegulators should be aware of unintended consequences of regulations.\nRegulatory costs are difficult to assess before a regulation is put in place. For this reason, many regulatory provisions include a sunset clause that requires regulators to revisit cost benefit analysis based on actual outcomes before renewing the regulation.\n\n\n\n\nRegulations can help or hinder a company or industry. Regulations may shrink the size of one industry."

    "text": "Unlike open-end mutual funds, ETFs are traded on secondary markets.\nThe ETF issuer designates authorized participants (APs). APs are permitted to create additional shares, or redeem existing shares, for a service fee payable to the ETF manager.\nThe in-kind creation / redemption process serves three purposes:\n\nLower cost\nTax efficiency\nKeeping market prices in line with NAV\n\nThis implies that ETFs should trade within a price band of the NAV, known as the arbitrage gap.\nInvestor -> ETF (상장) -> 추종하려는 Index (결국 ETF 가격은 Index 가격에 따라 움직임)\nAuthorized Participants (AP)라는 역할 존재\n상장이니까 가격 변동성 존재 (NAV에서 가격이 멀어질 수 있음) -> AP가 조절 by 증자, 감자\n장점\n\nLower Cost - 증자, 감자는 AP가 해주니 ETF Manager는 신경쓰지 않음\nTax Efficiency: ETF의 증자 / 감자는 비과세\nNAV와 가격 같게 유지 -> 그렇지 않으면 arbitrage gap 발생 가능\n\n\n\n\nIn the United States, the National Security Clearing Corporation (NSCC) guarantees the performance of parties to a trade on an exchange. The Depository Trust Company (DTC), a subsidiary of NSCC, transfers the securities from the account of the seller’s broker to the account for buyer’s broker at the end of the two-day settlement period. Market makers, due to their special significance, and due to the time required by the creation / redemption process, are afforded up to six days to settle their trades.\nETF는 주식처럼 상장되어 거래, NSCC가 성과 보증하고 DTC가 거래 소관 (2영업일 내에 거래 처리)\nAP는 증자 / 감자 거래 처리를 6영업일 안에 처리\n\n\n\nTracking difference is the divergence between an ETF’s return (based on its NAV) and the return on the tracked index. Tracking error is the annualized standard deviation of the daily tracking difference. Tracking error does not indicate whether the ETF under- or outperformed the index.\nETFs generally underperform the benchmark by their expense ratio.\nSources of tracking error include the following:\n\nFees and expense\nSampling and optimization\nDepository receipts (DRs) - due to time zone differences in capturing price data\nIndex changes\nRegulatory and tax requirements\nFund accounting practices\nAsset manager operations\n\nTracking difference: BM과 ETF return의 차이\nTracking error는 ETF가 Index보다 성과가 좋다 나쁘다 개념이 아님 - 잘 복제했느냐 개념\nETF가 BM보다 성과가 보통 낮은 이유 -> Fees, Sampling, DR, Index 변화, 규제 변화, Fund accounting, asset manager operation\n\n\n\nThe primary factors affecting ETF spread are the liquidity and the market structure of the underlying securities.\n\nSpreads on fixed-income ETFs tends to be larger than hose for large-cap equity ETFs.\nThe spreads are narrower during the overlapping time period when both markets are open.\nSpecialized ETFs, such as those that track commodities, volatility futures, or small-cap stocks, tend to have wider spreads.\nThinly-traded ETFs, regardless of the liquidity of the underlying, also command a higher spread.\n\nMaximum spread = creation (redemption) fees plus other trading costs + spread of the underlying securities + risk premium for carrying the trade until close of trading + AP’s normal profit margin - discount based on probability of offsetting the trade in secondary market\nBid-Ask spread가 영향을 미치는 주요 요인 - 해당 시장의 유동성, underlying security\n채권 ETF spread가 더 큼, specialized ETF spread가 더 큼\nMaximum spread = Creation fee + spread (기초자산) + risk premium + AP’s margin - discount (유통시장에서 거래되어 offsetting 될 수 있는 비용)\n\n\n\nThe NAV of an ETF is generally its fair value.\nETF premium (discount) % = (ETF price - NAV per share) / NAV per share\n\nTiming differences - ETFs on foreign securities may experience gaps between the time the ETF is traded and the time when the underlying trades in a foreign market.\nStale pricing - Infrequently traded ETFs may reflect noncurrent prices and, therefore, their value may differ from NAV.\n\nETF prices may be more informative than NAV or iNAV when 1) the market for the underlying is closed, 2) underlying securities are highly volatile or illiquid, or 3) there is a time lag between the pricing of the ETF and the pricing of underlying.\nETF는 일반적으로 fair value에 거래됨 - 거래소가 NAV를 공시\nETF premium = (ETF price - NAV price) / NAV price\npremium이나 discount 발생 이유 - timing difference, stale pricing\n하지만 NAV보다 ETF price가 더 의미있을 때도 있음 - 장전, 기초자산이 너무 변동성이 심할 때 등\n\n\n\nETF costs include management fees and trading costs.\nTrading costs include brokerage or commission fees and bid-ask spreads.\nFor shorter holding periods, trading cost dominates the cost of ETF ownership. Conversely, long-term investors are likely to seek out ETFs with low management fees.\nManagement fee + trading costs -> 경쟁이 치열하고 + passive라서 fee수준은 낮은 편\ntrading costs는 거래할 때만 발생 -> 보유기간이 길 수록 거래비요으이 비중은 감소 -> 장기투자자는 운용보수가 낮은 ETF 선호\n\n\n\n\n\nExchange-traded notes (ETNs), for example, have high counterparty risk. In the case of an ETN, an issuer (typically a bank) issues unsecured debt obligations that promise to pay the return on an index less management fees (just like a regular ETF).\nThe concern here is that the bank may default, resulting in losses for the ETN investor.\n\n\n\nETFs using OTC derivative contracts as part of their strategy expose investors to the settlement risk of such contracts.\n\n\n\nLike mutual funds, ETFs may lend their securities to short sellers for a fee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outcomes may differ from investors’ expectations\nThe compounding effects of leveraged ETFs make them unsuitable for buy-and-hold investors with investment horizons exceeding one month.\nCounterparty risk, settlement risk, security lending, fund closures, expectation-related risk (기대와 다른 효과)\n\n\n\n\nDue to their low costs, tax efficiency, and wide variety, ETFs are suitable for numerous portfolio strategies.\n\n\n\nPortfolio liquidity management\nPortfolio rebalancing\nPortfolio completion\nTransition management\n\n\n\n\nAllow a manager to implement a variety of strategies suitable for their clients.\n\nCore exposure to an asset class or sub-asset class\nTactical strategies\n\n\n\n\nNewer varieties of ETFs with an active component have gained traction, especially for fixed income.\n\nFactor (smart beta) ETFs\nRisk management\nAlternatively weighted ETFs\nDiscretionary active ETFs\nDynamic asset allocation and multi-asset strategies\n\nEfficient Portfolio management 활용 - liquidity, rebalancing, completion, transition\nassets class exposure management 활용 - core exposure, tactical strategy\nactive investing - factor ETF, risk management, alternatively weighted ETF, Discretionary active ETF, Dynamic asset allocation -> ETF는 유동성이 있으니 자유자재로 active하게 활용해서 \\(\\alpha\\)추구\n\n\n\n\nArbitrage pricing theory (APT) was developed as an alternative to the capital asset pricing model. However, unlike CAPM, APT does not identify the specific risk factors (or even the number of factors).\n\n\n\nUnsystematic risk can be diversified away in a portfolio\nReturns are generated using a factor model\nNo arbitrage opportunities exist\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\E(R_{P}) = R_{F} + \\beta_{P, 1}(\\lambda_{1}) + \\beta_{P, 2}(\\lambda_{2}) + ... +  \\beta_{P, k}(\\lambda_{k})\n\\]\n\\(\\lambda_{j}\\) equals the risk premium for a portfolio (called a pure factor portfolio) with factor sensitivity equal to 1 to factor j and factor sensitivities of zero for the remaining factors.\nUnlike the CAPM, the APT does not require that one of the risk factors is the market portfolio. This is a major advantage of the arbitrage pricing model.\nArbitrage pricing model -> CAPM 왜 한 개인지 의문이 발생 -> 수익률에 영향을 주는 게 더 많지 않을까라는 의문에서 개발 (베타 말고 다른 요인 찾기)\n가정\n\n비체계적 위험은 분산 가능\nReturn은 Factor model로 측정 가능\nArbitrage 기회 없음\n\n이름이 왜? - 위 2번 가정을 모두가 쓰면, 모두가 같은 \\(E(r)\\)을 계산 -> mispricing이 생겨도 금방 수정됨 -> arbitrage 기회 없음\nFactor Portfolio = 다른 Factor는 다 0으로 가정, Factor 1개만 1로 측정 -> 그래서 그 factor가 얼마나 영향을 주는지를 측정하기 ㅜ이함\n장점 - Factor를 다중 분석할 수 있음\n단점 - 어느 Factor를 써야하지? 통계적으로 맞다 하여도 쌩뚱맞은 변수를 쓰면 무슨 소용이지?\n\n\n\n\nThe APT assumes there are no market imperfections preventing investors from exploiting arbitrage opportunities.\nOver-valued는 short, 그 돈으로 under-valued 매수 -> 그 차이가 이익\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA multifactor model assumes asset returns are driven by more than one factor. There are three general classifications of multifactor models: 1) macroeconomic factor models, 2) fundamental factor models, and 3) statistical factor models.\n\nMacroeconomic factor models assume that asset returns are explained by surprises (or shocks) in macroeconomic risk factors. Factors surprises are defined as the difference between the realized value of the factor and its consensus predicted value.\nFundamental factor models assume asset returns are explained by multiple firm-specific factors.\nStatistical factor models use statistical methods to explain asset returns. Two primary types of statistical factor models are used: factor analysis and principal component models. The major weakness is that the statistical factors do not lend themselves well to economic interpretation. Therefore, statistical factors are mystery factors.\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\R_{i} = E_{R_{i}} + b_{i1}F_{GDP} + b_{i2}F_{QS} + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\\\R_{i} = \\text{return for Asset i}\n\\\\E_{R_{i}} = \\text{expected return for Asset i (in the absence of any surprises)}\n\\\\F_{FDP} = \\text{surprise in the GDP rate}\n\\\\F_{QS} = \\text{surprise in the credit quality spread (BB-rated bond yield - Treasury bond yield)}\n\\\\b_{i1} = \\text{GDP surprise sensitivity of Asset i}\n\\\\b_{i2} = \\text{credit quality spread surprise sensitivity of Asset i}\n\\\\\\epsilon_{i} = \\text{firm-specific surprise (unrelated to the two macro factors)}\n\\]\n\nEach “F” is a factor surprise, the difference between the predicted value of the factor and the realized value.\nThe firm-specific surprise captures the part of the return that can’t be explained by the model.\n\nBe careful to interpret the signs properly.\n\n\nA risk does not affect many assets can usually be diversified away in a portfolio and will not be priced by the market.\nThe factors in our example model, GDP and credit quality spread shocks, are systematic risk factors, meaning that they will affect even well-diversified portfolios.\n\n\n\nIn a macroeconomic multifactor model, asset returns are a function of unexpected surprises to systematic factors, and different assets have different factor sensitivities.\nThe factor sensitivities of the model can be estimated by regressing historical asset returns on the corresponding historical macroeconomic factors.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\R_{i} = a_{i} + b_{i1}F_{P/E} + b_{i2}F_{SIZE} + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\\\R_{i} = \\text{return for stock i}\n\\\\F_{P/E} = \\text{return associated with the P/E factor}\n\\\\F_{SIZE} = \\text{return associated with the SIZE (market capitalization) factor}\n\\\\a_{i} = \\text{intercept}\n\\\\b_{i1} = \\text{standardized sensitivity of stock i to the P/E factor}\n\\\\b_{i2} = \\text{standardized sensitivity of stock i to the SIZE factor}\n\\\\\\epsilon_{i} = \\text{portion of asset i return not explained by the factor model}\n\\]\nStandardized sensitivities (\\(b_{i1}\\) and \\(b_{i2}\\)). Sensitivities in most fundamental factor models are not regression slopes. Instead, the fundamental factor sensitivities are standardized attributes. \\[\n\\\\b_{i1} = \\frac{(P/E)_{i} - \\bar{P/E}}{\\sigma_{P/E}}\n\\] Factor returns (\\(F_{P/E}\\) and \\(F_{SIZE}\\)). The fundamental factors are rates of return associated with each factor. The dependent variable is the set of returns for all stocks and the independent variables are the standardized sensitivities.\n\n\n\n\nSensitivities - The standardized sensitivities in the fundamental factor model are calculated directly from the attribute data-they are not estimated. The macroeconomic model, in which the sensitivities are regression slope estimates.\nInterpretation of factors - The macroeconomic factors are surprises in the macroeconomic variables. In contrast, the fundamental factors are rates of return associated with each factor and are estimated using multiple regression.\nIntercept term - The intercept in the macroeconomic factor model equals the stock’s expected return. In contrast, the intercept of a fundamental factor model with standardized sensitivities has no economic interpretation.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211005210656567\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211005210702810\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211005210710178\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211005210715799\n\n\n\n\n\n\nActive return equals the differences in returns between a managed portfolio and its benchmark: \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{Active return} = R_{P} - R_{B}\n\\] Active risk (also known as tracking error or tracking risk) is defined as the standard deviation of the active return: \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{Active risk} = \\operatorname{tracking error} = \\sigma_{R_{P} - R_{B}}\n\\]\n\n\nActive return alone is insufficient for measuring an investment manager’s performance over a series of measurement periods.\nTo demonstrate a manager’s consistency in generating active return, we use the information ratio, which standardizes average active return by dividing it by its standard deviation. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{IR} = \\frac{\\bar{R_{P}} - \\bar{R_{B}}}{\\sigma_{R_{P} - R_{B}}}\n\\] The higher the IR, the more active return the manager earned per unit of active risk.\n\n\n\nimage-20211005211415233\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{active return} = R_{P} - R_{B}\n\\\\\\operatorname{factor return} = \\sum_{i = 1}^{k}{(\\beta_{pi} - \\beta_{bi}) * \\lambda_{i}}\n\\\\\\operatorname{security selection return} = \\operatorname{active return} - \\operatorname{factor return}\n\\\\\\beta_{pi} = \\text{factor sensitivity for the ith factor in the active portfolio}\n\\\\\\beta_{bi} = \\text{factor sensitivity for the ith factor in the benchmark portfolio}\n\\\\\\lambda_{i} = \\text{factor risk premium for factor i}\n\\]\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{active risk} = \\operatorname{tracking error} = \\sigma_{(R_{P} - R_{B})}\n\\]\nThe active risk of a portfolio can be separated into two components:\n\nActive factor risk\nActive specific risk\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{active risk squared} = \\operatorname{active factor risk}^{2} + \\operatorname{active specific risk}^{2}\n\\\\\\operatorname{active factor risk}^{2} = \\operatorname{active risk squared} - \\operatorname{active specific risk}^{2}\n\\]\n\n\n\nimage-20211006144910041\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nManagers seeking to track a benchmark can construct a tracking portfolio. Tracking portfolios have a deliberately designed set of factor exposures.\n\n\n\nActive managers use factor models to make specific bets on desired factors while hedging (or remaining neutral) on other factors. A factor portfolio is a portfolio that has been constructed to have sensitivity of one to just one risk factor and sensitivities of zero to the remaining factors. Factor portfolios are particularly useful for speculation or hedging purposes.\n\n\n\nThese strategies use rules to mechanically tilt factor exposures when constructing portfolios.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\E(R) = R_{F} + \\beta_{1}\\operatorname{RMRF} + \\beta_{2}\\operatorname{SMB} + \\beta_{3}\\operatorname{HML} + \\beta_{4}\\operatorname{WML}\n\\\\\\operatorname{RMRF} = \\text{return on value-weighted equity index - the risk-free rate}\n\\\\\\operatorname{SMB} = \\text{average return on small cap stocks - average return on large cap stocks}\n\\\\\\operatorname{HML} = \\text{average return on high book-to-market stocks - average return on low book-to-market stocks}\n\\\\\\operatorname{WML} = \\text{average returns on past winners - average returns on past losers}\n\\]\n\n\n\nimage-20211006145212417\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the CAPM framework, investors choose a combination of the market portfolio and the risk-free asset depending on their risk tolerance. By including more risk factors, multifactor models enable investors to zero in on risks that the investor has a comparative advantage in bearing and avoid the risks that the investor is incapable of absorbing.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006145246246\n\n\n\n\n\nValue at risk (VaR) measures downside risk of a portfolio. It has three components: the loss size, the probability (of a loss greater than or equal to the specified loss size), and a time frame.\nVaR can also be expressed in percentage terms so that for a portfolio, we could state that the 5% monthly VaR is 3%, meaning that 5% of the time the monthly portfolio value will fall by as least 3%.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006153109480\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006153117871\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006153122956\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne method of estimating VaR is the parametric or vairance-covariance method. Assuming normally allows us to estimate the risk of the portfolio based only on the means, variances, and covariances (or correlations) of the various risk factors. (skewness and kurtosis)\nAssuming normality, we can use the portfolio variance formula to estimate the mean and variance of portfolio returns. \\[\n\\\\\\sigma_{Portfolio}^{2} = W_{A}^{2}\\sigma_{A}^{2} + W_{B}^{2}\\sigma_{B}^{2} + 2W_{A}W_{B}Cov_{AB}\n\\] lookback period - The important point is that the parametric estimates we use should be those we expect over the period for which we are estimating the VaR.\nThe parametric method is relatively simple to apply under the assumption of normally distributed returns. The length of the lookback period will affect the parameter estimates. In cases where normality cannot be reasonably assumed, such as when the portfolio contains options, the parametric method has limited usefulness.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006153135086\n\n\n\n\n\nThe historical simulation method of estimating VaR is based on the actual periodic changes in risk factors over a lookback period.\nUnder the historical simulation method, no adjustment are made for the difference between the results for the lookback period and the results over a longer prior period.\nOne positive aspect of the historical simulation method is that we do not need the assumption of normality, or any other distributional assumption, to estimate VaR.\nVaR estimates will depend on the lookback period and, as with any forecasts, will vary with the characteristics of the sample data used.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006153141597\n\n\n\n\n\nA third method of VaR estimation is Monte Carlo simulation. Monte Carlo simulation is based on an assumed probability distribution for each risk factor.\nThis procedure is repeated thousands of times. As with the other methods, the data used and the assumptions about the distributions of the risk factors will have significant effects on the estimated VaR.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006153148238\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of VaR is simple and easy to explain.\nVaR allows the risk of different portfolios, asset classes, or trading operations to be compared to gain a sense of relative riskiness.\nVaR can be used for performance evaluation.\nWhen allocating capital to various trading units, a firm’s risk managers can also look at the allocation of VaR, and optimize the allocation of capital given the firm’s determination of the maximum VaR.\nGlobal banking regulators accept VaR as a measure of financial risk.\nReliability of VaR as a measure of risk can be verified by backtesting.\n\n\n\n\n\nVaR estimation requires many choices (loss percentage, lookback period, distribution assumptions, and parameter estimates) and can be very significantly affected by these choices.\nThe assumption of normality leads to underestimates of downside (tail) risk because actual returns distributions frequently have “fatter tails” than a normal distribution. Although the assumption of normality is not a requirement of VaR, it is almost always used, especially with the parametric method.\nLiquidity often falls significantly when asset prices fall.\nIt is well known that correlations increases, or spike, during periods of financial stress. VaR measures based on normal levels of correlation.\nWhile VaR is a single number that can be used to quantify risk, as with any summary measure, many aspects of risk are not quantified or included.\nVaR focuses only on downside risk and extreme negative outcomes. Including consideration of right-hand tail values will give a better understanding of the risk-return trade-off.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006153747046\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006153754436\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother measure based on Var is the conditional VaR (CVaR). The CVaR is the expected loss, given that the loss is equal to or greater than the VaR. For this reason, the CVaR is also referred to as the expected tail loss or expected shortfall.\nWhen the VaR is estimated using the historical simulation method or Monte Carlo simulation, we have all the losses greater than the VaR loss, so it is straightforward to take the average of these to get the CVaR. With the parametric method, we don’t know the magnitude of losses greater than the VaR, so calculating the expected loss in the left-hand tail is mathematically complex.\n\nVaR을 넘어선 손실에 대한 측정 - VaR을 넘어갔다고 가정\nHistorical & Monte Carlo - 계산이 어려움\nParametric - 계산 쉬움\n\n\n\n\n\nSecurity가 추가(감소) 될 때 증분 VaR\n\n\n\n\nWe can interpret it as the change in VaR for a 1% increase in the security’s weight. Thus, both the MBaR and IVaR can be used to estimate the change in VaR that will result from a change in the weight of a single security.\n\nPortfolio 안에 weight 들이 미치는 VaR 측정 for 위험관리\n직관적 이해 - Before & After = IVaR, 시점전날 전력투구 과목 고르기 = MVaR\n\n\n\n\n\nEx ante tracking error measures the VaR of the difference between the return on a portfolio and the return on its manager’s benchmark portfolio.\nBenchmark와 Portfolio의 차이 VaR\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk assessment using sensitivity analysis focuses on the effect on portfolio value given a small change in one risk factor. Portfolio risk can be better understood and more effectively managed. Unlike VaR, it does not invlove any prediction of the probability of losses of any specific amount.\n\n민감도 분석, 각 Factor의 영향력 분석\nspecific 확률을 제공하진 않음\n\n\n\n\nScenario analysis provides an estimate of the effect on portfolio value of a set of changes of significant magnitude in multiple risk factors.\n\n각 factor들의 가정들 set -> 결과값 -> 분석\nHistorical scenario - 역사적 기반\nHypothetical scenario - 가상값\nStress testing - 극단값\n\n\n\nA historical scenario approach uses a set of changes in risk factors that have actually occurred in the past.\n\n\n\nWith a hypothetical scenario approach, any set of changes in risk factors can be used, not just one that has happened in the past.\n\n\n\nStress tests examine the effect on value (or solvency) of a scenario of extreme risk-factor changes.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe risk factors used to measure the risks of equities, fixed-income securities, and options are all different. For equities, the most often used risk factor is beta. \\[\n\\\\E(R_{i}) = R_{f} + Beta_{i}[E(R_MKT) - R_{f}]\n\\] For fixed-income securities and portfolios, duration provides an estimate of how market values are affected by changes in interest rates (yield to maturity). For larger changes in interest rates, including the effects of convexity on fixed-income security values improves estimates of the sentisivity of the values of fixed-icnome securities to changes in interest rates. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{Change in price} = -Duration(\\Delta{Y}) + \\frac{1}{2}Convexity(\\Delta{Y})^2\n\\] Several risk factors affect the values of options positions. Delta is an estimate of the sensitivity of options values to changes in the value of the underlying asset.\n\nDelta, Gamma, Vega\n\n\nEquity - Beta\n\nCAPM\n\nFixed Income\n\nDuration, Convexity\n\nOption\n\nDelta, Gamma, Vega\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity risk measures can inform a portfolio manager about a portfolio’s exposure to various risk factors to facilitate risk management. Of course, eliminating all risk is not the goal.\nFactor sensitivities can be used to estimate the effects of small changes in risk factors for these securities.\nPricing models can be quite accurate when all of the relevant characteristics of a security are specified.\nScenario analysis is often performed as if the scenario changes were instantaneous.\nIn reverse stress testing, the first step is to identify a portfolio’s largest risk exposures. The question then becomes how likely such scenarios are. Using scenario analysis in this way can be beneficial in helping risk managers identify the vulnerabilities of a portfolio and perhaps mitigate the risk exposures identified.\nSensitivity risk measures - manager에게 risk들을 선택할 수 있게 활용 (베팅, 헷징)\nScenario analysis - 상황변화에 대해 즉각적인 대응을 가능하게 함\nReverse stress testing - testing을 통해 원인 찾기 -> 실제 일어날 수 있을지 여부 검토\n\n\n\n\nVaR, sensitivity analysis, and scenario analysis complement each other, and a risk manager should not rely on only one of these measures.\nThe problem with using duration as the risk measure is that the yield volatility of one portfolio may be quite different from the yield volatility of the other.\nVaR = %, loss 제공\nSensitivity analysis = 각 factor 별 영향 제공, %는 제공 안함\nScenario analysis = 각 factor set 별 영향 제공, %는 제공 안함\n서로 모두 보완역할\n\n\n\nFor each type of organization, differences among firms will result in differences in the risk measures used.\nBanks typically use sensitivity measures (duration of held-to-maturity securities and foreign exchange risk exposure), scenario analysis and stress testing (for their full balance sheets), leverage risk measures, and VaR (especially for trading securities). Banks also estimate risk from asset-liability mismatches, estimate VaR for economic capital, and disaggregate risk by both geographic location and business unit type.\nTraditional (long-only) asset managers typically focus on relative risk measures unless their goal is an absolute return target. A risk measure more specific to asset management is active share: the difference between the weight of a security in the portfolio and its weight in the benchmark.\nEx-post tracking error (backward looking) and ex ante tracking error (forward looking) measures provide different information. Ex-post tracking error is used for performance attribution and to assess manager skill over prior periods. Traditional asset managers mostly use ex ante tracking error for risk estimation. Managers with an absolute return target may use VaR instead.\nFor hedge funds, the risk measures used depend, to some extent, on the strategy employed.\nHedge funds with significantly non-normal returns distributions use a risk measure referred to as maximum drawdown: the largest decrease in value over prior periods of a specific length.\nDefined benefit pension funds calculate the difference between the present value of their assets (often market values) and the present value of their estimated future liabilitieis (payments to retirees and heirs). A risk measure used by pension funds is surplus-at-risk, a VaR for plan assets minum liabilities.\nInsurance companies are often subject to significant regulation of their products and their investment portfolios (reserves). Property and casualty insurers sell auto, home, boat, liability, and health insurance. Insurance risks are reduced by pruchasing reinsurance (from another insurance company) and by geographical diversification.\nP&C insurers use sensitivities of their exposures to market risk factors in their investment portfolios for risk management.\nThe insurance risk of life insurers is more highly correlated with the market risk exposures of their investment portfolios than it is for P&C insurers. The present value of these liabilities are quite sensitive to the discount factors used.\nBank - 보수적, 다 사용한다고 보면 됨\nTraditional (long-only) manager - 보통 relatvie risk measure (benchmark랑 비교)\n\nex-post tracking error - 성과평가 용으로 활용\nex-ante trackign error - risk 미리 측정으로 활용\nabsolute return은 VaR 활용\n\nHedge fund - 전략마다 다 위험지표 다름\n\n정규분포가 아닌 경우 -> Maximum drawdown 사용\n\nDB pension fund\n\nP(A) - P(L) = surplus -> 위험관리 대상\n\nInsurance\n\n손보사\n\nrisk가 market과 상대적으로 연관이 적음\n관리대상 - 보험료 + 운용수익으로 총 비용 cover가 가능한지 여부\n\n생보사\n\nlife time annuity 판매 -> 부채로 계상\n시장 할인율이 어떠냐에 다라 부채의 변동성이 심해지는 risk가 market과 상대적으로 연관이 높음\n\n\n\n\n\nRisk limits that are often imposed include following.\nRisk budgeting refers to a risk management process that first determines the acceptable total risk for an organization, and then allocates that risk to different activities, strategies, or asset classes as appropriate.\nPosition limits are one way to limit risk because they ensure some minimum level of diversification by limiting risk exposures. For example, position limit may be imposed on allocations to individual securities within an asset class, asset classes such as equities or high-yield bonds, investments in a single country, securities in a single currency or the differences between long and short positions for a hedge fund manager.\nScenario limits are limits on expected loss for a given scenario.\nStop-loss limits require that a risk exposure be reduced if losses exceed a specified amount over a certain period of time.\n\nRisk budgeting - firm의 risk를 정하고 -> allocation to 각 부서\nPosition limit - 특정행위 금지 (투기채, 특정주식, 특정국가 등)\nScenario limit - 주어진 시나리오에서의 제한행위\nStop-loss limit - 손실이 특정 범위를 넘어서면 risk exposure 감소시킴\n\n\n\n\nCapital aalocation decisions refer to how the capital of a firm is used to fund its various business units or activities, analogous to asset aalocation for a portfolio manager. Risk management, however, requires that the risk exposure for each use of firm capital be considered.\nOne way to introduce risk exposures to various activities into the capital allocation decision is to limit the overall risk of all the activities.\nrisk 무시하고 return 극대화를 위한 allocation? -> risk exposure를 고려해야 함 ex) VaR 배분\n\n\n\nThe value of any asset can be computed as the present value of its expected future cash flows discounted at an appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate.\nComponents of the discount rate are:\n\nReal risk-free discount rate (R)\nExpected inflation(\\(\\pi\\))\nRisk premium reflecting the uncertainty about the cash flow (RP)\n\nThe value of an asset will change if either the cash flow forecasts change or any of the components of the discount rate changes.\nValue = Cash flow / (1 + Discount Rate)\n\nValue는 CF가 변해도, 할인율이 변해도 변할 수 있음\n\nDiscount rate = real rate + inflation + risk premium\n\n할인율 역시 자산이 변해도, Investor의 기대가 변해도 변할 수 있음\n\n\n\n\nThe value of an asset depends on 1) its expected future cash flows and 2) the discounted rate used to value those cash flows. As market participants receive new information, the timing and amounts of expected future cash flows are revised and valuations change as a result. The impact of new information will depend on its effect on current expectations.\n기존의 expectation -> CF 추정 / 할인율 추정 -> 결과\n그런데 새로운 정보가 유입되어서 CF와 할인율이 변한다면 -> 기존의 결과가 변함\n\n\n\nThe real risk-free rate of interest derives from the inter-temporal rate of substitution, which represents an investr’s trade-off between real consumption now and real consumption in the future. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{inter-temporal\\, rate\\, of\\, substitution} = m_{t} = \\frac{\\operatorname{marginal utility of consuming 1 unit in the future}}{\\operatorname{marginal utility of current comsumption of 1 unit}} = \\frac{u_{t}}{u_{0}}\n\\] Investors always prefer current comsumption over future consumption (\\(u_{0}>u_{t}\\)) and \\(m_{t} < 1\\) as a result. \\[\n\\\\P_{0} = E(m_{t})\n\\\\R = \\frac{1 - P_{0}}{P_{0}} = \\frac{1}{E(m_{t})} - 1\n\\]\n\nThe higher the utility investors attach for current consumption relative to future consumption, the higher the real rate.\nInvestor’s marginal utility of consumption declines as wealth increases.\nIf investors expect higher incomes in the future, their expected marginal utility of future consumption is decreased relatvie to current consumption.\nInvestors increase their savings rate when expected returns ar high or when uncertainty about their future income increases.\n\nReal risk-free rate -> inter-temporal rate of subsitution (현재의 소비 vs 미래의 소비)\nMt = 미래효용 / 현재효용\n투자자는 항상 현재를 더 선호 -> Mt < 1\n\n\n\nimage-20211007163653421\n\n\n기억해야 할 것\n\n현재가 더 중요한 투자자 -> 더 높은 real rate을 가짐\n부가 증가하면 소비효용은 감소한다 -> 소비효용이 증가하면 부가 감소하는 것을 의미 (경기 수축)\n미래 수입의 증가를 기대 -> 미래 현재효용이 감소\n미래 불확실성이 증대, 기대 return이 증가 -> 투자자의 saving 증가\n\n\n\nThe risk aversion of investors can be explained by the covariance of an investor’s inter-temporal marginal rate of subsitution and expected on savings. Investors experience a large loss of utility for a loss in wealth as compared to a gain in utility for an equivalent gain in wealth. This property is called as risk-aversion.\nAn investor’s absoulte risk-aversion declines with their wealth; wealther investors are less risk-averse and more willing to take risk relative to their poorer counterparts. However, the marginal utility of holding risky assets declines as an investor holds more risky assets in her portfolio. \\[\n\\\\P_{0} = \\frac{E(P_{1})}{1 + R} + cov(P_{1}, m_{1})\n\\\\R = \\text{the real risk-free rate}\n\\] The covariance between the expected future price of the bond and the investor’s inter-temporal rate of substitution can be viewed as a risk premium. For risk-averse investors, the covariance is negative; when the expected future price of the asset is high, the marginal utility of future consumption relative oto current consumption is low. Everything else constant, the lower current price(\\(P_{0}\\)) increases expected return.\nrisk aversion\n\n같은 gain loss에서 loss에 더 고통스러워하는 자\n부자일수록 absolute risk aversion은 감소\n부자일수록 less risk averse, willingness to take risk 가능성 증가\nrisky asset이 많을수록, risk asset의 한계효용은 감소\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211007163853789\n\n\n\n\n\nIf GDP growth is forecasted to be high, the utility of consumption in the future (when incomes will be high) will be low and the inter-temporal rate of substitution will fall; investors will save less, increase real interest rates. Therefore, real interest rates will be positively correlated with real GDP growth rates.\nGDP growth rate이 높은 것으로 기대\n\n미래소비 효용 감소, less save\n자금이 귀해지고 real interest rate 증가\n결국 real interest rate과 GDP 변동성은 상관계수가 positive 관계\n\n\n\n\n\nNomial risk-free interest rates include a premium for expected inflation (\\(\\pi\\)). However, actual inflation is uncertain.\nFor short-term risk-free securities, the uncertainty about inflation is negligible. \\[\n\\\\r(\\operatorname{short-term}) = R + \\pi\n\\\\r(\\operatorname{long-term}) = R + \\pi + \\theta\n\\] For longer term bonds, we add the risk premium for uncertainty about inflation, \\(\\theta\\).\nActual inflation을 고려하자 (nominal)\n\nShort-term = R + inflation\nLong-term = R + inflation + actual\n\n\n\nCentral banks are usually charged with setting policy rates so as to 1) maintain price stability and 2) achieve the maximum sustainable level of employment. \\[\n\\\\r = R_{n} + \\pi + 0.5(\\pi - \\pi^{*}) + 0.5(y - y^{*})\n\\\\\\pi^{*} = \\text{central bank's target inflation rate}\n\\\\y = \\text{log of current level of output}\n\\\\y^{*} = \\text{log of central bank's target (sustainable) output}\n\\]\n\nprice stability를 유지하며, 고용수준 최대 달성목표\n중앙은행의 정책 이자율\n\n\n\n\nWhen the economy is in recession, policy rates tend to be low. Leads to higher longer-term rates. This results in a positively sloped yield curve. Conversely, expectations of a decline in GDP growth results in a negatively sloped (inverted) yield curve. For this reason, an inverted yield curve is often considered a predictor of future recessions.\nA term spread is the difference between the yield on a longer-term bond yield and the yield on a short-term bond. Evidence suggests that normal term spread is positive so the yield curve is upward sloping.\n\nrecession -> policy rate은 low\n경기침체 벗어나기 위해 GDP 기대 올리고 + inflation 적절히 관리\nYC가 우상향 (positively sloped YC)\nGDP 감소 trend -> negatively sloped YC\nInverted YC가 종종 경기침체의 signal로 관찰됨\nTerm spread = LT bond - ST bond\nNominal term이 + -> upward YC\n+라는 것은 -도 존재한다는 것을 의미\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between the yield of a non-inflation-indexed risk-free bond and the yield of an inflation-indexed risk-free bond of the same maturity is the break-even inflation rate (BEI). \\[\n\\\\BEI = \\operatorname{yield\\, on\\, non-inflation-indexed\\, bond} - \\operatorname{yield\\, on\\, inflation-indexed\\, bond} = \\pi + \\theta\n\\] BEI is composed of two elements: expected inflation (\\(\\pi\\)) and a risk premium for uncertainty about actual inflation (\\(\\theta\\)).\n\n\n\nThe required rate of return for bonds with credit risk includes an additional risk premium. This credit risk premium (credit spread) is the difference in yield between a credit risky bond and a default-free bond of the same maturity. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{required rate of return for credit risky bonds} = R + \\pi + \\theta + \\gamma\n\\\\\\gamma = \\text{additional risk premium for credit risk} = \\text{credit spread}\n\\] Creadit spreads tend to rise during times of economic downturns and fall during expansions.\nWhen credit spreads narrows, credit risky bonds will outperform default-free bonds. Overall, lower rated bonds tend to benefit more then higher rated bonds from a narrowing of credit spreads (their yields fall more). Conversely, when credit spreads widen, higher rated bonds will outperform lower rated bonds on a relative basis (because their yields will rise less).\nCredit RP = 같은 만기 credit risky bond - default free bond\nrequired rate = r + inflation + risk premium + yield curve credit spread\neconomic downterm -> spread 증가\neconomic expansion -> spread 감소\n경제 위축 -> default 증가 -> credit loss 증가\nbond 성과 -> spread가 좁아질 때 -> lower rate > higher rate\nspread가 넓어질 때 -> lower rate < higher rate\n\n\n\nSpreads differ among sectors and over time. Differences in credit spreads are primarily due to differences in indsutry products and services and the financial leverage of the firms in the industry. Spreads for issuers in the consumer cyclical sector invrease significantly during economic downturns compared to spreads for isseurs in the consumer non-cyclical sector.\n산업별로, 시간별로 spread 차이가 발생 - product, service, leverage 차이\n\n\n\nCyclical industries tend to be relatively more sensitive to the phase of the business cycle. Companies in these industries have revenues and earnings that rise and fall with the rate of economic growth. Defensive or non-cyclical industries tend to be relatively immune to fluctuations in economic activity; their earnings tend to be relatively stable throughout the business cycle.\n\ncyclical industry -> business cycle에 더 민감, economic growth rate이 중요\ndefensive -> 상대적으로 덜 영향\n\n\n\n\nThe discount rate used to value equity secutiries includes an additional risk premium, the equity risk premium because equity is more risky than debt. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{Discount rate for equity} = R + \\pi + \\theta + \\gamma + \\kappa\n\\\\\\kappa = \\text{additional risk premium relative to risky debt for an investment in equities}\n\\\\\\lambda = \\text{equity risk premium} = \\gamma + \\kappa\n\\] Assets that provide a higher payoff during economic downturns are more highly valued because of the consumption hedging property of the asset. Equity prices are generally cyclical, with higher values during economic expansions when the marginal utility of consumption is lower. Equity investments, therefore, are not the most effective hedge against bad consumption outcomes.\nDiscount rate = R + inflation + risk premium + y + k\n\n\n\n경기침체 시 더 payoff 하는 자산이 good\n이런 자산은 risk premium이 감소\n경기확장 시 equity는 가격증가 - cyclical -> 주식투자는 경기침체 시 좋은 hedge 수단이 아님\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice multiples such as P/E and P/B are often used in determining the relative values of companies, of sectors, or of the overall market from a historical perspective. However, it is inappropriate to judge the multiple in a historical context only.\nPrice multiples are positively correlated with expected earnings growth rates and negatively correlated to required returns.\nShiller’s CAPE (real cyclically adjusted P/E) ratio reduces the volatility of unadjusted P/E ratios by using real prices in the numerator and a 10-year moving average of real earnings in the denominator.\nPrice multiple (P/E, P/B)\n\n회사별 sector별 역사적 관점으로 판단 x\nearning growth %와 price multiple은 상관계수가 +\nrequired return과 price multiple은 상관계수가\n\n\n\n\nGrowth stocks are characterized by high P/Es and by low dividend yields and tend to be in immature markets with high growth prospects. Value stocks tend to have low P/Es, have high dividend yields, and are generally found in established and mature markets.

Getting the timing right is of course very difficult. The point, however, is that understanding and forecasting the relationship between the equity market performance of different sectors and the business cycle would help analysts enhance their sector rotation strategies.\nRotation = cyclical vs. non-cyclical\n분석 필요 - correlation, risk premium 등\n\n\n\nCommercial real estate investments have\n\nBond-like characteristics.

Active return can be measured ex-ante or ex-post.\nActive weights in a portfolio determine the amount of value added. Active weights must sum to zero.\nExpected returns on the active and benchmark portfolios can be computed as the weighted average of securities returns: \\[\n\\\\E(R_{P}) = \\sum{w_{Pj}E(R_{Pj})}\\, and\\, E(R_{B}) = \\sum{w_{Bj}E(R_{Bj})}\n\\\\E(R_{A}) = \\sum{w_{Pj}E(R_{Pj})} - \\sum{w_{Bj}E(R_{Bj})}\n\\] Active return can be decomposed into two parts:\n\nAsset allocation return\nSecurity selection return\n\n사전적, 사후적으로 측정 가능\n\n\n\n\nThe Sharpe ratio (SR) is calculated as excess return per unit of risk (standard deviation): \\[\n\\\\SR = \\frac{R_{P} - R_{F}}{\\sigma_{P}}\n\\] An important attribute of the Sharpe ratio is that it is unaffected by the addition of cash or leverage in the portfolio.\nThe information ratio (IR) is the ratio of the active return to the standard deviation of active returns, which is known as active risk: \\[\n\\\\IR = \\frac{R_{P} - R_{B}}{\\sigma_{(R_{P} - R_{B})}} = \\frac{R_{A}}{\\sigma_{A}} = \\frac{\\operatorname{active return}}{\\operatorname{active risk}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe information ratio that we are considering is usually the ex-ante information ratio. The ex-ante information ratio is generally positive, while ex-post information ratios will often turn out to be negative.\nA closet index fund is a fund that is purposed to be actively managed but in reality closely tracks the underlying benchmark index. These funds will have a Sharpe ratio similar to that of the benchmark index, a very low information ratio, and little active risk. After fees, the information ratio of a closet index fund is often negative.\nA fund with zero systematic risk that uses the risk-free rate as its benchmark would have an information ratio that is equal to its Sharpe ratio.\nUnlike the Sharpe ratio, the information ratio will change with the addition of cash or the use of leverage. Adding cash to a portfolio is likely to lower active return.\nThe information ratio of an unconstrained portfolio is unaffected by the aggressiveness of the active weights. If the active weights of a portfolio are tripled, the active return and the active risk both triple, leaving the information ratio unchanged.\nThe resulting blended portfolio will have the same information ratio as the original actively managed portfolio, leaving the information ratio unchanged.\nInvestors can select an appropriate amount of active risk by investing a portion of their assets in the active portfolio and the remaining portion in the benchmark.\n\nFor an unconstrained active portfolio, the optimal amount of active risk is the level of active risk that maximizes the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio. This optimal amount of active risk can be calculated as: \\[\n\\\\\\sigma_{A}^{*} = \\frac{IR}{SR_{B}}\\sigma_{B}\n\\\\SR_{P} = \\sqrt{SR_{B}^{2} + IR^{2}}\n\\] \n\n\n\nimage-20211008062659880\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe information coefficient (IC) is a measure of a manager’s skill. IC is the ex-ante, risk-weighted correlation between active returns and forecasted active returns.\nThe transfer coefficient (TC) can be thought of as the correlation between actual active weights and optimal active weights. For an constrained active portfolio, the active weights will be equal to the optimal weight and TC = 1.\nBreadth (BR) is the number of independent active bets taken per year.\n\n\\[\n\\\\IR = TC * IC * \\sqrt{BR}\n\\\\E(R_{A}) = TC * IC * \\sqrt{BR} * \\sigma_{A}\n\\]\nIR의 3가지 구성항목\n\nInformation coefficient - manager skill\nTransfer coefficient - 자유도 정도\nbreadth - number of independent active part\n\nGrinold rule - modified active return 개념\nIR을 늘리려면? - IC를 증가시키거나, BR을 늘리거나\n\n\n\nPortfolio theory concludes that investors choose some combination of the risk-free asset and an optimal risky portfolio, with the weights determined by their preferences (risk tolerance). The optimal risky portfolio is the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio. The portfolio with the highest information ratio will also be the portfolio with the highest Sharpe ratio, so investors will choose the active manager with the highest Sharpe ratio. \\[\n\\\\E(R_{A}) = IR * \\sigma_{A}\n\\] 결론\n\noptimization risk portfolio - highest Sharpe ratio\nHighest IR portfolio - highest Sharpe ratio portfolio\n\n\n\n\nMarket timing is simply a bet on the direction of the market (or a segment of the market). \\[\n\\\\IC = 2(\\operatorname{\\%\\, of\\, correct}) - 1\n\\]\n\n\nMarket timing can also be used to make sector rotation decisions. \\[\n\\\\\\sigma_{C} = [\\sigma_{X}^{2} - 2\\sigma{_X}\\sigma_{Y}\\rho_{XY} + \\sigma_{Y}^2]^{1/2}\n\\] 시장방향에 베팅\n우수한 성과를 보이는 sector에 자산 할당\n\n\n\n\nThe practical limitations of the fundamental law of active management can be summarized as “garbage in, garbage out;” poor input estimates lead to incorrect evaluations. In the case of unconstrained optimization, the two components (inputs) that determine the information ratio are 1) the information coefficient (IC) and 2) the breadth (BR) of the manager’s strategy.\nThe limitations are generally derived from inaccurate estimates of the two inputs:\n\nEx-ante measurement of skill - Managers tend to overestimate their ability to outperform the market and, hence, overestimate their IC.\nIndependence - If two or more decisions rely on same (or similar) information, then they are not independent.\n\n\\[\n\\\\BR = \\frac{N}{1 + (N - 1)r}\n\\\\N = \\text{number of decisions}\n\\\\r = \\text{correlation between the decisions}\n\\]\nLimitation - ex ante manager skill - 고평가\nindependence - 진짜 결정이 다 독립적?\n그래도 성과평과 input이 적으니 편함\n\n\n\nEvaluation of trade execution should not only consider explicit costs such as brokerage fees but also implicit costs.\n\n\nExplicit trading costs include brokerage, taxes, and fees.\nImplicit costs are harder to measure, and include the bid-ask spread, market or price impact costs, opportunity costs, and delay costs (or slippage).\n\nThe bid-ask spread is the highest potential cost for a small trade.\nMarket impact (or price impact) is the impact of demanding illiquidity in the market.\nDelay cost (or slippage) is the cost of an adverse price movement during the lag in executing a large trade.\nOpportunity cost arises from unfilled orders or failed trading opportunities.\n\nNote that there is a tradeoff between the market impact cost on one hand and the delay plus opportunity cost on the other.\n\nExplicit cost - brokerage, taxes, fee\nImplicit cost - Bid-ask spread, market impact, delay cost, opportunity cost\n\ntradeoff 존재 - market impact vs delay + opportunity cost\n\n\n\n\nLarger orders have a price impact as they move down the order book (and, therefore, execute at worse prices).

Several benchmarks can be used to evaluate trades, including the effective spread, VWAP, and implementation shortfall.\n\n\nThe effective spread transactions cost uses the midquote price as the benchmark price. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{per-share\\, effective\\, spread\\, transaction\\, cost} = \\operatorname{side} + (\\operatorname{transaction price} - \\operatorname{midquote price})\n\\\\\\operatorname{side} = \\text{+1 for buy orders and -1 for sell orders}\n\\\\\\operatorname{effective spread} = 2 * \\operatorname{per-share\\, effective\\, spread\\, transaction\\, cost}\n\\] If the trade occurs at a better price, there will be a price improvement.\nSince the effective spread is less than the quoted spread, there was not a price improvement on that trade.\nLimitations of effective spread\n\nWhen a larger order is split into smaller orders, the effective spread is a poor indicator of trade performance.\nEffective spread also does not account for slippage or delay costs when part of the order does not get filled at desired prices.\nEffective spread does not capture the opportunity cost of a trade.\n\nSpread는 낮을수록 거래를 잘한 것\n단점 - 거래량을 무시 -> delay cost, opportunity cost 반영 못함 (거래가 이루어지지 않았을 경우)\n\n\n\nVWAP is easy to interpret-it evaluates the price at which an order was executed relative to other trades occurring during the same time period.\nTo evaluate a trade, the VWAP of the trade is compared to the benchmark VWAP. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{VWAP transaction cost} = \\operatorname{trade size} * \\operatorname{side} * (\\operatorname{trade VWAP} - \\operatorname{benchmark VWAP})\n\\] Limitations of VWAP transaction cost\n\nVWAP is not useful if the trade being evaluated is a significant part of the trading volume.\nVWAP does not capture the price impact cost.\n\n하루에 거래한 내역들을 가중평균(거래량 기준)한 가격\nBM VWAP과 비교\n단점 - 거래량이 영향 -> 거래량이 너무 많으면 BM과 별 차이 없어짐, price impact cost 반영 못함 (단 1개의 거래로 가격이 상승했을 경우)\nVWAP의 탄생 -> 장 마감 직전까지 기다렸다가 거래를 하려는 manager들이 생김 -> implementation shortfall 탄생\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation shortfall is a conceptual approach that measure transactions costs as the difference between the value of the actual portfolio and the value of hypothetical paper portfolio.\nIt measures the total cost of trading by capturing all three implicit costs (i.e., price impact, slippage, and opportunity costs).\npaper portfolio와 actual portfolio를 비교\npaper portfolio는 가상의 portfolio로 trade가 모두 원래 계왹한 가격에 이루어졌다고 가정 -> actual과의 비교로 price impact, slippage, opportunity costs 모두 잡아냄\n\n\n\n\nThe use of information technology in the development of electronic markets has resulted in lower trading costs and improved execution efficiency.\nFactors driving development of electronic trading systems are\n\nCost\nAccuracy\nAudit trails\nFraud prevention\nContinuous market\n\nBond market trades remain largely over the counter.\n기술발달 -> 수요공급자들을 보다 빠르게 연결 -> trading cost 감소, 거래효율성 증가\n장점 - costs, accuracy, audit trail, fraud prevention, continuous market\n주식시장 대부분 electronic trading, 그러나 아직 채권시장은 dealer에게 많이 의존 (OTC)\n\n\n\nMarket fragmentation occurs when a security trades in multiple markets.\nAutomated trading strategies for large orders seek out liquidity across all markets to minimize the price impact of their trades.\n특정주식이 여러시장에서 거래될 때 -> market fragmentation 발생 -> 각 시장의 liquidity 차이로 cost 발생 가능\n대안 - 자동화 기술 -> liquidity aggregation - 모든 시장을 다 뒤짐 / smart order - 제일 효율적인 시장 고름\n\n\n\n\n\nThese analyze high-speed news feeds and submit market orders (as opposed to limit orders) based on the analysis.\n뉴스를 빠르게 분석하여 시장 거래, AI 사용하기도 함\n\n\n\nThese post bid and offer prices to profit from the spread. Dealer profit depends on the frequency with which they trade, Electronic dealers maintain a low inventory of actively traded securities and quickly adjust their positions based on market information.\nBid-ask spread로 이익 추구, low inventory (빠르게 position이 adjusted되어서)\n\n\n\nThese trade in multiple markets seeking to exploit price discrepancies.\nprice discrepancies 찾아다님\n\n\n\nThese use artificial intelligence to sniff out large trades (or many small trades) on the same side and then use low latency to trade ahead of them. Front runners search for patterns in order submissions or relationships between orders and events.\n빠르게 행동하는 trader, 대량거래 발생 전에 해당주식 매수하여 매도 (pattern과 event를 분석)\n\n\n\nStanding limit orders provide valuable information to other traders; they disclose the intend of the trader posting the order to buy or sell the specified quantity.\n특정가격에 매수/매도 주문 -> 그 자체만으로도 다른 trader들에게 의미있는 정보\n\n\n\nThese execute trades on behalf of their portfolio managers.\nportfolio manager의 주문을 받아 대신 거래하는 trader\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to lower trading costs, electronic trading system allow low-latency traders a competitive advantage by jumping the order queue. In other words, electronic traders have to be faster than their competitors to capitalize on market opportunities.\nLow-latency traders focus on minimizing the latency involved in three phases of a trade:\n\nThe time gap between the publication of actionable news and the receipt of that news by the trader.\nThe time gap between the receipt of actionable news and deciding on an appropriate action.\nThe time gap between order determination and communicating that order to the exchange.\n\n\nCommunication speed\nComputation speed\n\nelectronic trading -> low latency, 대응속도가 빨라짐 -> 과거보다 빠르게 시장의 개회를 capture 가능\n1: 시장에서 정보의 발생 -> 2: trader가 정보를 취득 -> 3: trader가 의사결정 후 명령 -> 4: 거래 수행\n2, 4: communication speed\n3: computation speed\n\n\n\nAdvanced order types are limit orders with a dynamic limit price that varies with a benchmark.\nTrading tactics are plans calling for the submission of multiple orders.\nAlgorithms (or algos) are programmed execution strategies using multiple orders, sequencing of orders, and trading tactics to achieve specific goals.\n\n\n\nHidden orders\nLeapfrog - This is the practice of beating the best bid or ask price. A leapfrogging limit order therefore narrows the inside spread.\nFlickering quotes - These are exposed limit orders that are submitted and canceled almost immediately.\nElectronic arbitrage\n\nTake liquidity on both sides - This is an arbitrage trade to buy and sell the same security in different markets to take advantage of mispricing across markets.\nOffer liquidity on one side\nOffer liquidity on both sides - This strategy is fraught with risks; after one leg of the order is filled, if the other leg does not fill, the trader is exposed to risk of adverse price movement.\n\nMachine learning - Also known as data mining, machine learning involves using statistical modeling techniques that allow the model to evolve based on new data.\n\nadvanced order type - limit order with a dynamic limit price\n\n\n\nimage-20211008074458164\n\n\nalgorithms - 미리 설정&프로그램 된 전략으로 trading\nElectronic trading의 영향\n\nhidden orders - 기존 거래방식(bid-ask)을 따르지 않고, 거래정보(단가, 규모)를 공개하지 않은 상태로 거래\nleapfrog - ask 관련 dealer들의 경쟁 심화 -> bid-ask spread가 좁혀짐\nflickering quotes - 주문 후 바로 취소, 상대방이 해당 주문 가격으로 먼저 제안하기를 바라는 전략 (우리 물량은 공개하기 싫을 때)\narbitrage\n\ntake liquidity on both sides - 다른 시장에서 다른 가격으로 판매되는 security들을 동시에 buy&sell (market order)\noffer liquidity on one side - 특정주식을 싼 시장에서 사서 비싼시장에 팔기 (limit order)\noffer liquidity on both sides - 특정주식을 best 가격보다 비싸게 사서 다른 시장에 팔기 (limit order) -> 위험노출\n\nmachine learning - data mining, 통계, 새로운 data로 알고리즘 개발 -> 극단 case에는 안 들어 맞을수도\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHigh-frequency traders (HFT) arms race - This arms race offsets some of the lower cost benefits of electronic trading.\nSystemic risk\n\nRunaway algorithms - These produce a series of unintended orders. The flash crash of May 2010 was caused by a trading algorithm.\nFat finger errors - These are input errors.\nOvercharging orders - These demand liquidity significantly higher than what is available in the market.\nMalevolent orders - These are created to specifically manipulate the market. Examples includes aggrieved employees programming rogue trades and traders seeking to conduct denial-of-service attacks on their competitors with excessive submission of quotes.\n\n\nhigh-frequency trader (HFT) arms race - 최첨단 시설 구축으로 인한 비용 (cost 증가)\nsystematic risk - 기술의 발달로 인해 피해자들이 발생할 수 있음\n\nrunaway algorithms, fat finger errors, overcharge orders, malevolent orders\n\n\n\n\n\nFront running -This is low-latency trading ahead of known large trades.\nMarket manipulation - This includes activities that produce false market data, including price and volume data.\n\nTrading for market impact - These are trades designed to change the price.\nRumormongering - This involves dissemination of fake information to affect the target trader’s value assessments.\nWash trading - This is trading between commonly controlled accounts to create an impression of false liquidity.\nSpoofing or layering - These are fake limit orders posted to create fake optimism or pessimism about the security.\nBluffing - This involves preying on momentum traders.\nGunning the market - This focuses other traders into bad trades.\nSqueezing and cornering\n\n\nfront running - low-latency trading head of known large trade\nmarket manipulation - 거짓된 data로 시장 조작\n\ntrading for market impact (시장가격 영향주기)\nrumormongering (루머)\nwash trading (자전거래)\nspoofing & layering (optimism 또는 pessimism으로 시장가보다 다른 가격 제시, 시장 흔들기)\nbluffing - 모멘텀 투자자들\ngunning the market - stop-loss 주문한 투자자들 노리기, 대량 short하여 나오는 물량 사기\nsqueezing & cornering - 상대방으로 default 위험에 처하게 해서 이익 추구"

    "text": "Capital appreciation\nThe main deriver of long-term equity returns is capital (or price) appreciation.\n\nDividend income\ndiversification - Equity securities offer diversification benefits due to less than perfect (i.e., less than +1) correlation with other asset classes. However, the risk reduction is not constant. During a financial crisis correlations tend to increase, limiting the diversification benefit. In addition, asset class standard deviations could increase, further reducing the expected reduction in portfolio risk.\nInflation hedge - In some cases, individual equities or equity sectors may provide a hedge against inflation. Studies generally show positive correlation between equity real returns and inflation, but the relationship varies over time and by country. Other studies show that equities and inflation become negatively correlated during periods of hyperinflation. In addition, equity prices are typically a leading economic indicator while inflation is a lagging economic indicator; also suggesting a less than perfect correlation between equity return and inflation."

    "text": "Client investment considerations\nThe decision to include equities or the kinds of equities to include in a portfolio also depends on client investment considerations as outlined in the investment policy statement (IPS). Clients with a high risk tolerance may prefer growth-oriented companies, while clients with a low risk tolerance may prefer stable, well-established companies that pay dividends.\nClient constraints may include environmental, social, and governance (ESG) considerations and religious beliefs.\n\nNegative screening (i.e., exclusionary screening), which excludes companies or sectors that do not meet client standards.\nPositive screening (i.e., best-in-class screening), which seeks to uncover companies or sectors that rank most favorably with clients.\nThematic investing, which screens equities based on a specific theme, such as climate change. A related approach is impact investing, which aims to meet investor objectives by becoming more actively engaged with company matters and / or directly investing in company projects."

Investment style can be determined by analyzing company metrics, such as price-to-earnings ratios, price-to-book ratios, dividend yield, and earnings and / or book value growth.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nAdvantages to segmenting by size and style include:\n\nPortfolio managers can better address client investment considerations in terms of risk and return characteristics.\nThe potential for greater diversification benefits by investing across different sectors or industries.\nThe ability to construct relevant benchmarks for funds that invest in a specific size/style category.\nThe ability to analyze how company characteristics change over time.\n\nThe last advantage is also a disadvantage in that the categories are not stable over time."

One disadvantage to this approach is that investing in international equity markets may subject investors to currency risk. Another disadvantage is an overestimation of the diversification benefit. But the companies may have already diversified their business internationally and may even derive much of their income from the investor’s country."

A production-oriented approach segments companies by products manufactured and inputs required during the production process. For example, a market-oriented approach may classify a coal company in the energy sector, while a production-oriented approach may classify that same company in the basic materials sector.\nAn advantage to economic activity segmentation is that it allows portfolio managers to analyze, compare, and construct performance benchmarks based on specific sectors / industries. In addition, diversification benefits are enhanced when investments span different sectors / industries. The main disadvantage to this approach is that some companies, especially larger firms, may have business operations that are not easily assigned to one specific sector or industry."

example, a market-cap weighted index with 500 stocks might have an HHI of 0.01 and, therefore, an effective number of stocks of 1 / 0.01 = 100. The fact that 100 is less than the number of stocks in the portfolio reflects the disproportionate effect of the largest capitalization stocks in the index. An equal weighted index of 500 stocks would have an HHI of 0.002 and an effective number of stocks of 1 / 0.002 = 500.\nRebalancing is the process of adjusting portfolio weights as index weighting change. Rebalancing incurs trading costs (and possibly tax costs) and will decrease returns.\nReconstitution is the process of removing and replacing stocks that no longer fit the desired market exposure of an index. Reconstitution will also reduce index portfolio returns as trading costs are incurred.\nTwo practices are used to reduce trading costs associated with migration of a stock between indexes on reconstitution dates. Buffering refers to the practice of establishing a threshold level for the change in a firm’s capitalization rank that must be met before moving it from one index to another on a reconstitution date.\nPacketing - With packeting, when a mid-cap company’s capitalization increases so that it qualifies as large-cap stock, half of the portfolio position is moved to the large-cap index on the reconstitution date."

Additionally, minimization of tracking error can result in portfolios that are not mean-variance efficient.\nThe advantages of optimization techniques are reduction of tracking error relative to stratified sampling and that they explicitly account for the covariances of constituent stock returns, rather than relying on a characteristics, such as industry sector, in constructing the portfolio."

An undervalued company has an inexplicably low multiple relative to the industry average.\nContrarian investing - Purchasing or selling securities against prevailing market sentiment.\nHigh-quality value - Equal emphasis is placed on both intrinsic value and evidence of financial strength, high quality management, and demonstrated profitability (the “Warren Buffet” approach).\nIncome investing - Focus is on high dividend yields and positive dividend growth rates.\nDeep-value investing - Focus is on extremely low valuations relative to assets, often due to financial distress.\nRestructuring and distressed debt investing\nSpecial situations - Identifies mispricings due to corporate events such as divestures, spin-offs, or mergers.\n\nGrowth-based approaches attempt to identify companies with revenues, earnings, or cash flows that are expected to grow faster than their industry or the overall market.\n\nConsistent long-term growth\nShorter-term earnings momentum\nGARP (growth at a reasonable price); looking for growth at a reasonable valuation.

The strategy profits from mean reversion if the long (previous underperform) now outperforms, while the short (previous outperformer) now underperforms. The risk is that the breakdown of the observed previous relationship is long term in nature, there is no mean reversion, and in fact the long continues to underperform the short position in the pairs trade.\nMarket microstructure-based arbitrage strategies take advantage of mispricing opportunities occurring due to imbalances in supply and demand that are expected to only last for a few milliseconds."

    "text": "First building block: overweight/underweight rewarded factors\nThis relates to the manager taking exposures to rewarded risks that differ from those of the benchmark. This can be thought of as active return due to differences in beta, where beta refers to sensitivity to a rewarded risk factor such as the market risk of CAPM, or the market, size, and value factors of the Fama and French model. With exposures to rewarded factors increasingly accessible via rules-based index products, simple static exposure to rewarded factors is no longer widely considered a source of alpha. This building block relates primarily to active return source number one: differences in exposures to long-term rewarded factors."

    "text": "Second building block: alpha skills\nAlpha skills are excess returns related to the unique skills and strategies of the manager. A manager can generate alpha through factor timing, which is skill in identifying when a factor might outperform / underperform its average return. This could apply to a rewarded factor (e.g., correctly determining when value stocks will outperform growth stocks), but it could also apply to unrewarded factors, such as correctly timing geographical or industry sector exposures, commodity prices, or even security selection (a discretionary manager might refer to these as thematic exposures). This building block relates primarily to active return source number two: identifying mispricings."

    "text": "Third building block: sizing positions\nPosition sizing balances managers’ confidence in their alpha and factor insights while mitigating idiosyncratic risks coming from concentrated positions. Position sizing will affect all three sources of active risk, but the most dramatic impact will be on idiosyncratic risk. The general rule is that smaller positions in a greater number of securities will diversify away idiosyncratic risk and lead to lower portfolio volatility.\nA factor-oriented manager who spreads their portfolio across many assets is likely to minimize the impact of idiosyncratic risk. A stock-picker is likely to hold more concentrated positions based on their insights into individual securities, and hence, deliberately assume a high degree of idiosyncratic risk."

variance of the skill of the manager (alpha) is deemed to be part of the idiosyncratic risk component here.\nResearch conclusion on the composition of active return include:\n\nHigh net exposure to a risk factor leads to high level of active risk.\nA portfolio with no net factor exposure will have active risk attributed entirely to Active Share.\nActive risk attributable to Active Share is inversely proportional to the number of securities in the portfolio.\nActive risk increases as factor and idiosyncratic risk levels increase."

    "text": "Distinguishing between different portfolio management approaches\nActive risk and Active Share can be used to discriminate between different portfolio management approaches, with respect to their factor exposures and level of diversification.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nDifferent portfolio management approaches\n\nA closet indexer is defined as a fund that advertises itself as being actively managed but is substantially similar to an index fund in its exposures.\n\nActive Share (a number between 0 and 1) measures how similar the portfolio is to the benchmark in terms of its stock holdings; the lower the value of Active Share, the closer the portfolio is to the benchmark.\nA manager makes factor bets when their portfolio’s exposure to one or more risk factors differs from that of the benchmark. Taking factor bets necessarily involves increased Active Share, whereas a higher value of Active Share does not necessarily imply that factor bets have been taken (for example, a manager might hold stock A instead of stock B, but the two stocks may have identical factor exposures).\nActive risk measures the extent to which the active return (portfolio return minus benchmark return) varies from period to period. It can be seen as a consequence of Active Share and factor bets.\nManager styles can also be identified through observing their sector and security-specific constraints. For example, a sector rotator would need to have large permitted deviations in sector weights, while a stock picker would need to have large permitted deviations in individual security weights. A diversified multi-factor investor would not need such large deviations from index weights, but would still need some flexibility in order to generate a moderate level of active risk and return.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Determining the appropriate level of risk\nPractical considerations when considering the appropriate level of portfolio risk include:\n\nImplementation constraints - Constraints on short positions or on leverage may limit the manager’s ability to under / overweight. Liquidity issues may increase costs as a manager increases active risk, which leads to a degradation of the information ratio as the extra costs weigh on active returns.\nLimited diversification opportunities - We know from basic portfolio theory that increasing risk leads to decreasing marginal increases in expected returns (this gives rise to the concave efficient frontier of Markowitz). Portfolio with higher risk/return targets eventually run out of high-return investment opportunities and lose the ability to diversify efficiently, thereby reducing the Sharpe ratio.\nLeverage and its implications for risk - While leverage could be used to solve issue number two in a single period (allowing the portfolio to move up the linear capital allocation line, rather than following the curved efficient frontier), too much leverage will eventually bring a reduction of expected compounded return in a multi-period setting.

    "text": "Additional risk measures\nRisk constraints can be classified by heuristic or formal.\n\nHeuristic risk constraints are based on experience on general ideas of good practice. Examples include limits on exposure to individual positions, sectors or regions, limits on leverage, or measures designed to control the degree of illiquidity and turnover in the portfolio.\nFormal risk constraints are often statistical in nature. A key distribution between formal and heuristic risk measures is that formal risk measures require forecasts of return distributions, which introduces estimation error. Examples include limits on volatility, active risk, skewness, drawdowns, and VaR-based measures including:\n\nConditional VaR (CVaR)\nIncremental VaR (IVaR)\nMarginal VaR (MVaR)\n\n\nOther points of note regarding risk constraints include:\n\nLeverage magnifies the negative impact of incorrect risk estimations.\nUnexpected increases in volatility can also derail investment strategies. Managers may tighten risk controls in more volatile periods to protect the portfolio from losses.\nRisk measures used depend on the style of management. A benchmark-agnostic manager with an absolute return philosophy is less likely to be concerned with statistical measures such as active risk and more concerned with more practical measures such as portfolio drawdown.\nPortfolio with fewer positions will have higher estimation errors due to the random specific risks of concentrated positions, hence using formal risk measures is likely to be more difficult.\n\nThe fewer positions, the more difficult formal risk."

    "text": "The merits of long-only investing\n\nLong-term risk premiums, such as the market premium, are earned by investors going net long securities. Investors that short sell securities over the long term will therefore suffer negative returns. Investors that have shorter time horizons concerned about negative returns may prefer strategies that have short exposures.\nThe capacity and scalability of a long-only strategy is set by the liquidity of the underlying securities. This means the capacity of long/short strategies is likely to be lower than for long-only strategies, particularly those large-cap funds that face few long-only capacity issues.\nDue to limited legal liability laws, the maximum a long investor can lose is the amount they paid for the security (if the security falls to zero). The potential loss to a short seller is unlimited, however, as they lose as stock price rise, and stocks prices have no price ceiling.\nRegulations allow some countries to ban short selling in the interests of financial market stability.\nTransactional complexity is higher for a long/short fund. A short seller must source shares to borrow, provide collateral to the lender of the shares, and faces the risk the lender recalls the shares at an inopportune time. A short seller usually appoints a prime broker to deal with stock borrowing and collateral functions, which introduces an extra layer of counterparty risk, because if the prime broker goes bankrupt collateral may be lost.\nCosts are likely to higher for long/short funds than long-only funds both in terms of management fees and operational expenses.\nThe personal ideology of an investor might cause then to object to short selling."

    "text": "Long/short portfolio construction\nGross exposure is the sum of the value of the long positions plus the absolute value of the short position, expressed as a percent of investor’s capital. Net exposure is the difference between the value of the long positions and the value of the short positions, again expressed as a percentage of investor’s capital.\nSpecific types of long/short funds include long extension and market-neutral funds.\nLong extension portfolios are long/short strategies typically constrained to have a net exposure of 100%. This is a constrained form of long/short fund, in that the manager has no real discretion over gross/net exposure. This would be preferred by investors that want 100% net market exposure but also wish to allow the manager to engage in some level of short selling in order to benefit from negative views.\nMarket-neutral portfolios aim to remove market exposure through their long and short exposures. The objective will be to neutralize risks where the manager believes they have no comparative advantage is forecasting, allowing them to concentrate on their specific skills. Often market-neutral strategies are used for diversification purpose, rather than for the purpose of seeking high returns."

    "text": "The benefits and drawbacks of long/short strategies\nLong/short strategies offer the following benefits:\n\nGreater ability to express negative ideas than a long-only strategy. This will increase the information ratio because lower constraints will increase the transfer coefficient of the manager (TC, measuring their ability to translate insights into investment decisions).\nAbility to use the leverage generated by short positions to gear into high-conviction long ideas.\nAbility to remove market risks and act as a diversifying investment against other strategies.\nGreater ability to control exposure to risk factors.\n\nLong/short strategies contain the following drawbacks:\n\nThis means potential losses are unlimited because security prices are not bounded above. It also means the manager is reducing long-term exposure to the market risk premium.\nSome long/short strategies require significant leverage, which magnifies losses as well as gains.\nThe cost of borrowing securities can become too high, particularly for securities that are difficult to borrow.\nLosses on the short position will increase collateral demands from stock lenders, particularly if leverage has been used. The manager may also be vulnerable to a short squeeze, where a sudden rise in the price of a heavily-shorted security forces short sellers to cover positions, buy back shares and potentially force the share price higher. Lenders of securities could also recall shares at inopportune times causing disruption to the manager’s strategy."

However, these objectives may not be precisely defined, as the private client may not be able to quantify the size of the investment portfolio required as the start of retirement or the annual cash flows required to fund the college expenses of departments. The investment objectives of a private client can change over time due to life events and/or the performance of the client’s investment portfolio. In addition, certain investment objectives may be difficult to reconcile, such as financial security in retirement and the ability to generously fund charitable projects at the same time.\n\nIdentification\nQuantification\nPrioritization → Goals-based investment (pyramiding)\n\nInstitutional clients, on the other hand, are more likely to have clearly defined objectives that are usually focused on funding liabilities (e.g., defined benefit pension plans and insurance companies).

    "text": "Analysis of retirement goals\nA private client’s retirement goals can be analyzed using mortality tables, annuities, and Monte Carlo simulation.\n\nMortality tables\nA mortality table shows life expectancy for an individual at different ages and enables a private wealth manager to determine the probability that a client will survive to a given age.\nThey are based on the individual’s current age and show the probability for the average individual who has attained that age.\nThese probabilities can be used to weight the expected annual cash flows of a client in retirement to estimate the present value of the client’s retirement spending needs. It should be noted that, since mortality tables provide survival probabilities for an average individual, they might understate the actual probability of a given private client reaching a specific age, meaning that the client is faced with longevity risks. (disadvantage)\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nWhile no explicit calculations using mortality tables are acquired in this reading, they are used to calculate core capital (PV of sum of expected living expense) in the retirement stage of life.\n\n\nAnnuities\nThe present value of the client’s retirement spending needs can be determined by pricing an annuity. The buyer of an annuity makes an upfront payment in exchange for receiving a series of specified payments over time. An immediate annuity guarantees specified monthly payments for a predetermined period, with payments beginning immediately. Other types of annuities include a deferred annuity, where monthly payments begin at a specified time in the future, while a life annuity makes monthly payments for as long as the annuity holder is alive. If a private client’s retirement spending needs are expected to be relatively stable over the client’s life expectancy (from mortality tables), a life annuity can be used to reduce longevity risk and the price of a life annuity can be used as an estimate of the amount of financial resources required to fund the client’s retirement goals.\n\n\nMonte Carlo simulation\nMonte Carlo simulation can be used to determine the probability that a private client’s investment portfolio will meet the client’s financial goals in retirement. The simulation can be tailored to the client’s actual portfolio asset allocation and used to explore different retirement scenarios. This flexibility is important to private wealth managers because a client’s retirement spending needs are usually more complex than fixed monthly cash flows (e.g., the client may wish to make a charitable donation before or at death).\nThe output of a Monte Carlo simulation will only be as good as its input assumptions. Furthermore, while the simulation provides the probability of success, it does not usually consider the amount by which the investment portfolio falls short of the client’s retirement goals. This shortfall magnitude is an important consideration for retirement planning, as the client will need to resolve this shortfall."

A wealth manager providing a nondiscretionary service can make investment recommendations but it unable to act on the recommendation without client approval.\n\nRebalancing methodology\n\nA time-based rebalancing (e.g., quarterly, semiannual, or annual rebalancing) does not consider deviations between actual and target asset class percentages, whereas a threshold-based rebalancing approach means that the portfolio is rebalanced once actual asset class weights deviate from target weights by a prespecified amount. - corridor\n\nTactical changes\n\nThe IPS should clearly state if a private wealth manager is given discretionary authority to undertake tactical asset allocation changes. The IPS should clearly state the acceptable range of weights for each asset class as well as the extent to which the manager is allowed to go beyond the upper or lower bounds (SAA range) when making tactical changes.\n\nImplementation\n\nThis section covers information about acceptable investment vehicles (e.g., the use of in-house and/or external money managers, ETFs, mutual funds) and the due diligence process for making investment decisions."

Mean-variance optimization, which can be structured to maximize expected returns for a given level of risk or to meet a specified probability of success, is carried out for each goal portfolio rather than for the entire portfolio.\nThis is another illustration of behavioral portfolio theory, which suggests that investors construct their portfolios in layers with different return expectations and risk perceptions for each layer.\nWith goals-based investing, clients may find it easier to specify their risk tolerance, as this is expressed for each goal portfolio rather than for the client’s entire portfolio. A key disadvantage of this approach is that the client’s entire portfolio may not be mean-variance efficient.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

net sales price is the price after deduction of commissions and trading costs. Often, the tax basis is simply the original cost of the asset. In some jurisdictions, there could be a “step-up” in basis to fair market value on the date of death with no capital gains taxes owing. In other jurisdictions, the step-up occurs upon death or departure in residency, but any unrealized gains would be taxed.\ntax basis (취득원가) 상향조정 → 상속자산의 경우 tax basis = fair market value\nRealized capital gains occur upon the actual disposition of an asset. Unrealized capital gains are “paper gains,” which represent appreciation on unsold items. In situations where there is a realized capital loss, most jurisdictions allow the realized capital loss to reduce any realized capital gains.\nDepending on the holding period of the investments, the capital gains may be subject to a short-term (usually higher) rate or a long-term (usually lower) rate. The rationale behind the rate differentials is to encourage long-term investment and discourage short-term speculation. If countries have low long-term capital gains tax rates, this means that stocks are more tax-efficient investments than bonds, the latter of which are taxed at regular rates.\nStock has tax deferral effect."

This means items such as interest, depreciation, and repairs are deductible against the gross income of the property. In the case of depreciation (e.g., straight line or declining over a specified number of years), the annual expense would reduce the cost base. Upon the ultimate sale of the property, there may be a recapture of depreciation if the proceeds of the sale exceed the property’s depreciated cost base."

However, relief may be provided in the form of tax credits by the home jurisdiction for tax already paid in the source jurisdiction or bilateral tax treaties. Often, taxes are imposed on only residents of the jurisdiction, so it is crucial to determine the jurisdiction in which one is a resident. It is usually based on the amount of time spent in the jurisdiction (e.g., considered resident if living there fore 183 of 365 days of the year). Tie-breaker rules exist so that individual are not in the onerous position of being a resident in two jurisdictions simultaneously.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Tax efficiency\nTax efficiency of various asset classes and investment strategies - tax minimization\nA tax-efficient strategy results in relatively high after-tax returns compared to pretax returns. Frequently, equities have greater tax efficiency versus fixed income and real estate, for example. Common reasons include 1) lower tax rates on dividends and capital gains in many countries and 2) the ability to time securities dispositions to maximize tax benefits.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nOften, alternative assets are selected because of low correlations to traditional assets such as stocks and bonds. However, the tax laws pertaining to alternative assets (e.g., hedge fund strategies, partnerships) are usually far more complex than for traditional assets. As a result, the impact of alternative assets on portfolio risk and return should always be viewed from an after-tax and after-fee perspective.\nInvestments that emphasize high-yield (interest income) and/or high turnover are often tax inefficient. At the same time, timing must also be considered, and in that regard, a momentum strategy with higher turnover might initially be viewed as tax inefficient. However, momentum strategies are quite tax efficient in that they hold winners longer (thereby deferring tax on gains) and sell losers sooner (thereby realizing earlier to offset against any gains). As a general note, investment constraints that require managers to sell securities (and realize gains) and rebalance portfolios more frequently result in less tax efficiency (e.g., in some jurisdictions, short-term capital gains are taxed higher than long-term capital gains).\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThere are four common metrics used in examining tax efficiency:\n\nAfter-tax holding period return\n\nRelevant taxes are computed and deducted when investments are disposed of\nAccounts for interest income, dividend income, and realized gains/losses but not unrealized gains/losses\n\nAfter-tax post-liquidation return\n\nAn extension of what was just listed but there is an assumption of overall portfolio disposition after a specific period (e.g., 5 or 10 years)\nThis measure accounts for unrealized gains/losses.\n\nAfter-tax excess returns\n\nEither of the metrics just listed compared to a benchmark value\n\nTax-efficiency ratio\n\nAfter-tax annualized total return versus pretax annualized total return\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

it appears the TEA is superior to the TDA because there is no tax due on withdrawals. However, this ignores that TEA contributions are made with after-tax funds and TDA contributions are mad with pretax funds. Suppose an investor has $100 pretax available for savings and is in the $30 tax bracket. The full $100 can be contributed to a TDA and invested. If that contribution is not made, the investor will owe $30 in taxes now and have only $70 for contribution to the TEA."

    "text": "Asset location\nwhich account?\nThe concept of asset location refers to whether to place asses in taxable, tax-exempt, or tax-deferred accounts. In general, tax-efficient assets (e.g., equities that generate capital gains, which are often subject to lower tax rates) should be place in taxable accounts and tax-inefficient assets (e.g., taxable bonds that generate taxable interest, which is often subject to higher tax rates) should be place in tax-exempt or tax-deferred accounts. However, exceptions may apply if equities held for the long term or subject to high turnover could avoid the negative and compounding effects of short-term taxes by being held in tax-exempt accounts and generating a comparatively higher after-tax return.\nBond → regular coupon → interest income tax → TEA or TDA\nTaxable accounts have the advantage of allowing losses incurred to be offset against gains earned (similar to tax loss harvesting). As well, in determining whether equities should be included in taxable versus tax-deferred accounts, consider the capital gains tax rate for the former and the tax rate upon withdrawal for the latter. For example, an overly low capital gains tax rate or an overly high marginal income tax rate at retirement would favor equities inclusion in taxable accounts. A low marginal income tax rate at retirement would generally favor equities inclusion in tax-deferred accounts.\nFor equity strategies, there is often the trade-off between passive strategies (more tax efficient due to low turnover and fewer transaction costs) versus active strategies (less tax efficient due to high turnover and more transaction costs) in that passive strategies often have lower returns than active strategies. In other words, there is a choice between 1) more tax efficiency and lower return and 2) less tax efficiency and higher return. (always higher after-tax return)\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

This certainly true for a flat tax at all levels of income. In contrast, for a progressive tax system  where marginal tax rates (누진세, 마지막에 $에 적용된 tax rate) increase with income, it would make sense to “use up” the lower tax brackets with withdrawals from tax-deferred accounts first."

    "text": "Investment vehicles\nFour common vehicles include partnerships, mutual funds, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and separately managed accounts (SMAs).\n\nPartnership\nHedge funds and private equity funds are often structured as partnerships. Here, the partnership has no tax liability and taxes are usually allocated to the partners in the form of capital gains distributions, the latter of which are often taxed at lower rates.\n\n\nMutual fund\nInvestment income (e.g., dividends, interest) is allocated to the investors and tax is paid by the investors based on when the income was received. Capital gains tax arises if the investor disposes of the fund shares based on the excess of proceeds and tax basis.\nIn some countries, investors must pay their proportion of taxes for realized capital gains that occur within the fund. The fund net asset value (NAV) is lowered by the amount of the capital gains distribution.\nNew mutual fund shareholders may become liable for unrealized capital of prior periods. Consider an example of a fund that is established with 10 investors and assets of $20 million. Over time, with no trading nor change in investors, the assets have increased in value to $24 million, so there is a $4 million embedded gain. Therefore, each investor has a tax basis of $2 million and a share investment worth $2.4 million. Assuming one new investor comes in a invests $2.4 million, the fund’s total tax basis is $22.4 million and the fund’s NAV is $26.4 million. The new investor has a 1/11 ownership interest and the tax basis is $2036364 ($22.4 million/11). If the fund were immediately liquidated, the new investor would have a capital gains distribution of $363636 ($2400000 - $2035364) upon which there would be a tax liability. Therefore, the new investor is liable for taxes for which the investor did not benefit in terms of capital appreciation.\nMeasures such as the potential capital gain exposure (PCGE), calculated as net gains (losses) divided by total net assets, may provide some clues as the extent of embedded capital gains or untaxed capital appreciation in the fund that may become future tax liabilities for the investors. A high (low) PCGE suggests a high (low) likelihood of future capital gain distributions.\n\n\nETF\nThe ETF creation and redemption process is tax efficient because it allows managers the choice to transfer shares with a low cost basis to intermediaries (e.g., banks and brokerage firms). That will leave the ETF issuer with only the higher cost basis shares, which reduces the embedded capital gains and increases investors’ after-tax returns.\n\n\nSMA\nSMAs have the greatest potential for tax management because everything can be customized for only one investor."

    "text": "Tax loss harvesting\ntax strategy\nThe concept of tax loss harvesting involves the sale of securities with embedded losses to offset gains, which will lower the tax liability for the current year.\nOne consideration for tax loss harvesting is the timing of sales in relation to the tax year-end. If a sale is being considered near the tax year-end, make the sale:\n\nBefore year-end if it is a loss in order to place the loss in the current tax year and offset gains this year. That will lower taxes payable this year but increase taxes payable in the following year.\nAfter year-end if it is a gain. That will defer the gain and tax until the following year.\n\nWatch out for situations where wash sale (or superficial loss) rules exist whereby, for example, losses may be denied if the same security is purchased 30 days before or after its sale at a loss. Circumventing the wash sale rules would require holding cash, an ETF, or a place holder security for 31 days, which may be inconsistent with the desired exposures. Also, the subsequent repurchase of the security after 31 days, likely at a lower cost, means that there will be higher future capital gains. This is an example of how tax loss harvesting is a form of tax deferral.\nMany tax authorities allow a form of tax lot accounting. When an investor makes a partial sale and has acquired the stock on different dates, each at a different cost, the investor may select which tax lots applied to the sale (the specified-lot method). In that case, the tax lots that produce the lowest tax bill should be designated as sold. Consider an investor who bought 100 shares of stock on three different dates for $10000, $12000, and $15000. In this example,  the investor just sold 100 shares.\nHighest in, first out (HIFO) is generally optimal and the 100 shares with a cost basis of $15000 should be designated as sold. If the sales prices is higher than $15000, that will minimize the gain and capital gains tax due now.\nIn case future tax rates are expected to higher than current tax rates, first in, first out (FIFO) may be better and the 100 shares with a cost basis of $10000 should be designated as sold.\n\npurchase price 상승 가정\n\nIn case future tax rates are expected to be lower than current tax rates, last in, first out (LIFO) may be better and the 100 shares with a cost basis of $15000 should be designated as sold.\n\npurchase price 상승 가정\n\nBecause equity markets tend to appreciate over time, using LIFO is generally the most tax-efficient strategy. Here, the highest tax basis shares are sold first, which results in the lowest tax liability in the current period and defers the higher tax liabilities to future periods"

In that regard, tracking error is used as a measure of the risk of introducing tax management and quantitative methods are used to maximize tax efficiency.\nThe general idea behind quantitative tax management is to minimize tracking error and trading costs as well as to minimize realized gains and maximize realized losses. The goal is to manage all the while meeting any other portfolio constraints (e.g., sector, country).\nFor new clients who transfer in appreciated securities, there is a delicate balance between the tax cost (e.g., realized gains) of selling those securities versus potential underperformance of holding those securities for too long. Those appreciated securities may not be consistent with the new investment objective.\nTax-optimized loss harvesting refers to looking for opportunities during the year as opposed to doing so only once near the end of the year. The assets that are sold during the process must be replace, and therefore, the process uses quantitative methods to determine appropriate replacement assets that would be consistent with the portfolio’s investment objectives.\nGain-loss matching optimization can be used to achieve the goals of minimizing capital gains and ensuring risk exposures are in line with portfolio objectives. In other words, it is possible to have zero capital gains by not selling securities with embedded gains, but that may result in excessive concentration risk, for example."

Concentrated positions in a publicly traded single-stock position, a privately held business, or a real estate investment (not the primary residence) are covered in this module. A concentrated position may lead to inefficient asset allocation. An investment manager often works with the client to sell or otherwise monetize the asset.\nA narrower definition of “concentrated position” will be used here, referring to the inability to create a diversified and efficient portfolio resulting from low tax basis (e.g., large capital gains tax liability to be avoided) or emotional attachment.\nConcentrated single-asset positions also have company-specific risk, which is the nonsystematic risk of an investment that can be diversified away.\nFinally, concentrated positions could be subject to illiquidity and high transaction costs even if there is no tax due.\nIn choosing a strategy to manage the concentrated position, the following factors should be considered:\n\nlevel of concentration-the higher it is, the timelier the response needs to be to reduce the risk\ntax basis-the lower, the greater the taxes due\ntax rate-the higher, the grater taxes due\nliquidity-the more illiquid, the greater the costs of risk reduction\ntime horizon-more time may allow the concentration to be reduced gradually which lowers the overall cost\ninvestor restrictions-may prevent an outright sale\nnonfinancial matters-emotional attachments may hinder the risk-reduction process\n\nVarious strategies are available to manage concentrated positions, including:\n\nsell the entire position-incur the tax liability and use the after-tax proceeds to invest in a more diversified manner\nhedge and monetize-use derivatives to hedge (e.g., limit downside risk) and then borrow against its value and use the loan proceeds to accomplish client objectives.\nTax-free exchange funds-현물출자 fund\ncharitable gifts-assets can be transferred to private foundations and donor-advised funds where such assets can be sold and not incur any tax liabilities. Those funds could be used to achieve the donor’s charitable objectives.\nTax minimization strategies-some tax laws allow a tax-free step-up in basis if one holds an asset to death, which is a legal form of tax avoidance. A gradual disposition of a concentrated position spreads the tax liability out over a period of time and is an example of a tax deferral strategy.\nsell the entire position gradually over time-same as what was just listed but reduces risk of doing so at a suboptimal time."

There is both minimization of tracking error and maximization of after-tax return. Both objectives conflict because selling less shares at a time will reduce taxes but increase tracking error. In general terms, maximizing after-tax returns is achieved by realizing more capital losses and those capital losses are used to offset capital gains on the sale of the concentrated stock."

Also, for tax purposes, if the buy and sell premiums can be combined into one integrated transaction, it would be desirable, as it avoids any cash outflow associated with the taxation of the call premium income.\nIn terms of hedging, if a perfect hedge is used and removes all risk, it may be taxed as a sale (e.g., constructive sale).

Real estate is generally illiquid and, if held for a long time, may have a significant unrealized capital gain.\nTwo key strategies to consider include mortgage financing and a donor-advised fund or charitable trust.\n\nMortgage financing\nNormally,  a sale of an income-producing property to an external party results in the immediate payment of capital gains taxes, loss of control, and no ability to benefit from future appreciation. Therefore, mortgage financing can be an attractive strategy to raise funds without suffering from any of those three negative effects.\nWith a nonrecourse loan (비소구대출), the lender’s only recourse is to seize the property if the loan is not paid. The borrower effectively has a put option on the property. If the property value falls below the loan amount, the borrower could simply default on the loan, keep the loan proceeds, and “put” the property to the lender. A loan on income-producing property could have zero cash flow and zero tax effects on the borrower if the property’s income covers the interest on the loan and other property expenses. The concentration risk is reduced because the loan proceeds could presumably be invested in liquid and diversified investments.\nMortgage financing with non-recourse loan\nborrow\n\nlong put on the property\nlong call on the loan prepayment option\n\n\n\nDonor-advised fund (DAF) or charitable trust\nA DAF can allow the property owner to take a tax deduction, gift more money to the charity, and influence the use of the donation. For example, an investor owns property worth $5 million and would like to make a $5 million contribution to a local hospital in exchange for having a new children’s clinic named after his mother. The property was originally purchased for $3 million, and the investor has deducted $1.3 million of depreciation expense, making the current tax basis $1.7 million. If sold for $5 million, the investor would owe capital gains taxes on a $2 million capital gain and recapture taxes on $1.3 million ($3 million - $1.7 million). → depreciation recapture taxes (감가상각 환입세금) Instead, the investor could contribute the property to a DAF for the hospital and take a $5 million tax deduction, and the tax-exempt hospital could sell or retain the property with no tax due."

The trustee (manager of the trust) holds the assets and manages them in the best interests of the beneficiaries according to the constraints of the trust documents. Trusts are recognized by, and are most prevalent in, common law countries.\nAsset ownership can be a fuzzy concept with trusts. A trustee actually has possession of and manages the assets for the benefit of the settlor and/or beneficiaries and may be considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes only.\nIn a revocable trust, the settlor can rescind (revoke) the trust and resume ownership of the assets. The settlor is considered the legal owner of the assets for tax and reporting purposes, and persons such as creditors and divorcing spouses may make claims against the trust assets.\nIn an irrevocable trust, the settlor relinquishes ownership and control. The trustee is considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes and is responsible for  reporting and paying taxes on income generated by the trust. The irrevocable trust protects the trust assets from claims against the settlor.\nThere are several reasons for using a trust:\n\nAvoid giving control of assets to beneficiaries who would not be able to properly manage them.\nAvoid dilution of ownership interest in a private business in countries where there is joint ownership and division of assets acquired during marriage.\nAvoid probate."

Furthermore, the value of nonpublicly traded family business should be reduced to reflect lack of liquidity/marketability as well as reflect a minority interest discount if the ownership percentage sold does not provide control.

(중략) 나는 주가가 이미 많이 올라서 신고가를 갱신하고 있으며 상대 강도가 좋은 주식을 사려고 애쓴다. (중략) 나는 항상 현시점에서 잠재적인 성장 가능성이 가장 큰 종목을 찾는다. 지금 보유한 주식의 가격이 계속 오를 것 같아도, 다른 주식이 훨씬 더 큰 수익률을 낼 거라고 생각되면 옮겨 탄다.\n\n\n1990년대 닷컴 기업 주식을 재량적으로 매매하던 소위 ’총잡이들’을 종종 모멘텀 투자자라 불렀다. 이들은 타고 있던 말은 원래 가던 방향으로 가는 것이 제일 쉬운 거라고 생각했다. 이처럼 육감이나 경험에 근거한 재량적 모멘텀과, 체계적이며 규칙에 기반한 모멘텀 사이의 혼동은 오늘날도 존재한다.\n\n\n행동재무학이 모멘텀을 논리적으로 설명하는 도구로 등극한 가운데, 모멘텀에 관한 연구는 나라심한 제가디시와 쉐리단 티트먼(Narasimhan Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman, 1993)이 발표한 논문 「승자주 매수 및 패자주 매도 전략의 투자수익률: 효율적 시장 가설에 대한 암묵적 도전(Returns to Buying Winners and Selling Losers)」을 통해 일대 도약하게 된다.\n\n\n정량적 연구를 통해 모멘텀은 재량적 투자법에서 규칙에 기반한 투자법으로 변모했다. 제가디시와 티트먼의 연구는 3~12개월간 최강세주들이 향후 동일 기간 동안에도 최강세주임을 명백히 밝혀냈다. 기간이 6~12개월인 경우 특히 더 명백했다.\n\n\n규칙에 기반한 모멘텀 투자는 최근 6~12개월간 최강세주 상위 10~30%를 매수해 1~3개월 보유한 후 재평가해서 포트폴리오를 리밸런싱(rebalancing)하라고 조언한다. 이와 같이 규칙에 기반한 모멘텀 투자를 실시하면 의사결정 과정에서 행동 편향을 제거할 수 있고, 투자자가 시장 상황에 감정적으로 반응해 잘못 결정할 위험을 줄여줄 수 있다.\n\n\n모멘텀은 제1의 시장 이례 현상이다. 수익률이 낮았던 주식은 향후 수개월간 낮은 수익률을 보이는 경향이 있고, 수익률이 높았던 주식은 미래에도 높은 수익률을 보이는 경향이 있다.\n\n\n현재 세계 최대 뮤추얼펀드 회사인 뱅가드 그룹의 설립자이자 전 회장인 존 보글은 다음과 같이 말했다. “시장 수익률을 월등하게 능가할 펀드를 찾으려 하면 실패할 수밖에 없다. 희망과는 달리 과거 실적으로는 미래를 예측할 수 없는 것으로 판명났기 때문이다.”\n\n\n워런 버핏은 언젠가 이렇게 말했다.\n\n\n기관투자가든 개인 투자자든, 투자자 대부분이 주식을 소유하는 최상의 방법은 비용이 가장 적은 인덱스펀드임을 알게 될 것이다. 이 길을 택한 사람들은 투자 전문가 대다수가 각종 비용과 보수를 공제하고 최종적으로 제공하는 수익률을 틀림없이 능가할 것이다.\n\n\n버핏은 자신이 말한 대로 행한다. 그가 보유한 버크셔 해서웨이 주식은 그의 사후 자선단체에 기부될 예정이다. 상속자들을 위해 유산의 10%는 미국 정부의 단기 채권에 투자하고 나머지 90%는 저비용 S&P500 인덱스펀드에 투자하라고 버핏은 신탁관리자에게 일러두었다.\n\n\n유진 파마는 이렇게 말했다. “위험을 고려했을 때, 우연히 만나는 펀드매니저보다 꾸준히 초과수익을 낼 펀드매니저가 많을까요? 이 질문을 연구한 사실상 모든 경제학자의 대답은 압도적으로 ’아니요’입니다.”\n\n\n매수자 한 명이 있으면 그만큼 잘 아는 매도자 한 명도 있기 마련이고, 두 사람 모두 자신의 결정이 옳다고 생각한다. 이런 상황을 벤저민 그레이엄은 이미 오래전에 제대로 간파했다. “주식시장은 기관들이 서로의 빨래 뭉치를 주고받는 거대한 빨래터와도 같다.”\n\n\n우리는 시장에 감정적으로 대응하는 투자자의 나쁜 타이밍 결정이 이런 저조한 실적의 가장 큰 원인임을 이미 알고 있다. 투자자들은 손실을 계속 키운 다음에야 팔고, 시장이 반등하기 시작할 때 빠져나간다.\n\n\n브래드 바버와 테랜스 오딘(Brad Barber and Terrance Odean, 2000)은 가구당 평균 주식 투자수익률이 벤치마크와 비교했을 때 경제적으로나 통계학적으로나 상당한 차이로 뒤진다고 주장했다. 개인 투자자들은 포트폴리오의 80%를 해마다 변경한다. 앞서 4장에서 살펴봤듯이 투자자들은 과신과 처분 효과 때문에 잘못된 시기에 탐욕스러워지고 동시에 두려움에 빠져 너무 많이 거래한다.\n\n\n버핏은 이와는 정반대로 행동할 것을 추천한다. 다른 사람들이 두려움에 빠져 있을 때 탐욕스러워지고, 다른 사람들이 탐욕스러울 때 두려워하라고.\n\n\n개인 투자자는 정보와 전문성 면에서도 불리하다. 유명한 헤지펀드 매니저 마이클 슈타인하트(Michael Steinhardt)에게 개인 투자자를 위해 투자의 핵심 하나만 가르쳐주길 청하자 이렇게 답했다. “제가 그들의 경쟁자라는 사실입니다.”\n\n\n버핏은 “투자는 단순하다. 하지만 쉽지는 않다”고 했다.\n\n\n요약하면 일반 투자자는 다음과 같은 경향을 보인다.\n\n\n● 시장 변동성에 지나치게 감정적으로 대응한다\n\n\n● 포트폴리오의 변동성이 높고, 로또 같은 주식을 보유하며, 분산투자가 지나치게 덜 되어 있다\n\n\n● 자기 능력을 과신하고 보유한 주식을 지나치게 자주 사고판다\n\n\n● 정보 수집에 불리하다\n\n\n두 모멘텀을 함께 사용해서 양쪽의 장점을 모두 취하는 것이 가장 좋다. 먼저 상대 모멘텀을 이용해 최근 12개월간 가장 성과가 좋았던 자산을 선택한다. 이어서 절대 모멘텀을 추세 추종 필터로 사용해, 우리가 선택한 자산의 초과수익이 최근 1년간 양의 값인지 음의 값인지 살펴본다. 양의 값이면 추세 상승 중이므로 해당 자산을 이용한다. 음의 값이면 추세 하락 중이므로, 우리는 단기 내지 중기 채권을 대신 사용하면서 해당 자산의 추세가 양의 방향으로 돌아서기를 기다린다. 이런 식으로 하면 언제나 시장의 추세와 조화를 이룰 수 있다.\n\n\n자산배분을 위해 절대 및 상대 모멘텀 모두를 사용하는 듀얼 모멘텀 접근 방식은 투자자들이 일반적으로 해오던 것과 다른 패러다임의 대전환이다. 보통 주식시장 침체기에는 주식에서 일찌감치 빠져나올 방법이 없기 때문에 채권 같은 분산투자용 자산에 영구적으로 자산배분하기 마련이다.\n\n\n전 세계 시장이 더욱 통합되고 시장 간 상관관계가 더 높아진 것 역시 영구적인 자산배분이 과거와 달리 이제는 별 의미가 없어진 이유다. 시장 위기 상황에서 자산 간 상관관계가 높아진다는 것은 영구적인 자산배분이 기대만큼 위험을 낮춰주지 않는다는 뜻이다.\n\n\n상대 모멘텀과 절대 모멘텀이 서로를 얼마나 잘 보완하는지 볼 수 있다. 절대 모멘텀은 1982년과 2001년, 2008년 같은 주식시장 침체기에 효과를 발휘해 가치를 더한다. 반면 상대 모멘텀은 절대 모멘텀이 휴면에 들어가 시장보다 나을 것이 없을 때, 이를테면 1986~2000년, 2003~2007년, 2011~2013년 같은 시기에 빛을 발한다. 상대 모멘텀은 절대 모멘텀보다 수익률 개선에 더 기여하지만 변동성과 MDD의 감소 또한 현저하다. 상대 모멘텀과 절대 모멘텀의 수익률 간 상관관계가 0.69로 나타나, 둘 사이에 분산투자 효과가 있다는 주장에 힘이 실리는 점도 눈여겨볼 필요가 있다.\n\n\n투자자들은 현재 절대 모멘텀보다는 상대 모멘텀을 훨씬 더 많이 이용한다. 하지만 변동성과 MDD를 현격하게 감소시키고 샤프지수도 더 높은 절대 모멘텀이 위험조정수익률로 보면 더 낫다. 그렇다고 해서 둘 중 하나만 사용해야 하는 것은 아니다. 둘 다 사용함으로써 상호 보완적인 관계를 최대한 이용할 수 있다. 듀얼 모멘텀은 바로 이 점을 노린 것이다.\n\n\n듀얼 모멘텀을 이해하고 실행할 만큼 똑똑한 투자자에게는 과도하게 분산투자하려는 경향이 비생산적으로 보인다는 점을 이해했다.\n\n\n복잡하지 않고 단순한 절대 및 상대 모멘텀에 기초한 듀얼 모멘텀도 역시 단순하면서 단도직입적이다. 주된 매개변수는 반추 기간이다.\n\n\n제목도 아주 그럴듯하게 잘 지은 논문 「가짜 수학과 엉터리 금융: 외표본 실적의 백테스트 과최적화 효과(Pseudo-Mathematics and Financial Charlatanism)」(2014)에서 저자 데이비드 베일리 등(David Bailey et al.)은 “상대적으로 적은 수의 대체 전략을 백테스트하면 높은 투자 성과를 달성하기는 쉽다. (중략) 투자자들은 수학적으로 견실해 보이는 전략에 자본을 잘못 투자하기 십상이다”라고 했다.\n\n\n하지만 모멘텀에는 단 하나의 매개변수만 존재한다. 바로 반추 기간이다. 이는 더 이상 확인할 필요도 없을 정도로 입증되었다. 하지만 모형 대부분은 이처럼 간단하지 않고 과최적화 또는 과특정화(overspecification) 같은 문제가 늘 있기 마련이다.\n\n\n어떤 모형에 복잡성을 더하다 보면, 과거를 ’예측’하려고 완벽을 기하다가 너무 융통성 없이 엄격한 모형을 만들 수 있다. 그러면 정작 미래를 예측하는 데는 효과가 없을 수 있다.\n\n\n로페스 데 프라도(Lopez de Prado, 2013)에 따르면, 금융 데이터가 다양한 기억을 담고 있기 때문에 과최적화는 소음(무작위성)만 양산하는 것이 아니라 평균 회귀를 통해 종종 체계적인 외표본 손실을 초래한다. 백테스트 결과가 좋을수록 실시간 결과가 좋지 않다.\n\n\n노벨물리학상 수상자인 리처드 파인만(Richard Feynman)이 지적했듯이, “결과값을 계산하는 과정이 정해져 있지 않다면, 약간의 기술만 가지고도 어떤 실험 결과도 예상했던 결과처럼 보이도록 만들 수 있다”.\n\n\n수익률 분포의 매개변수는 시기에 따라, 경제가 처한 국면에 따라 다르다. 상대적으로 적은 데이터 표본은 일반적으로 전체를 대표한다고 볼 수 없고, 종종 백테스트 결과가 일관되지도 않다.\n\n\n일련의 연속적인 값이나 데이터 표본들이 동등하게 전체를 대표하는 성질을 에르고딕성(ergodicity)이라고 한다. 금융시장은 에르고딕성이 전혀 없다.\n\n\n주식시장의 국면 중에는 절대로 반복되지 않을 것들이 있는 반면, 상당히 다른 특징들을 보이면서 반복되는 것들도 있다.\n\n\n내가 보기에 다른 사람들이 흔히 저지르는 실수 중 하나는 15년처럼 제한된 양의 데이터를 가지고 모형을 개발한 후 이를 근거로 미래에 믿을 만한 결과를 기대하는 것이다.\n\n\n절대 모멘텀의 수익률은 1903년까지 거슬러 올라가도 상당할 뿐만 아니라 일관성이 있다. 상대 모멘텀은 심지어 1801년까지 거슬러 올라가도 그렇다. 내가 아는 한 금융시장에서 이렇게 방대한 데이터로 백테스트한 경우는 이것뿐이다.\n\n\n데이터가 풍부하면 연구 결과가 다양한 시장 상황에 걸쳐 일관되고 안정적인지, 아니면 그저 짧은 기간 몇몇의 뛰어난 실적에 의존하는지를 알 수 있다. 특히 최악의 시나리오는 얼마나 많은 과거 데이터를 입수할 수 있느냐에 더 큰 영향을 받는다.\n\n\n통계학자 에드워즈 데밍(W. Edwards Deming)은 “우리가 믿는 하느님에 관한 일이 아니라면, 데이터를 제시하시오”라고 말한 것으로 전해진다.\n\n\n내가 듀얼 모멘텀을 설명해준 사람들 중에는 이를 ’제1의 이례 현상’으로 받아들이지 않고, 주력 투자 전략이 아닌 틈새 전략으로 인식하는 사람들이 있다. 짐작되는 이유가 몇 개 있다. 첫째, 내가 소통을 너무 못해서.(이 책을 사서 읽는 독자들을 위해 제발 사실이 아니길 바랄 뿐이다.) 다음으로 꼽을 수 있는 것이 그 흔한 행동 편향들, 즉 새로운 것에 직면할 때 나타나는 정박 효과와 보수주의 등이다. 게다가 투자자들은 뭔가를 배울 때 느리고 낯선 것보다는 익숙한 것을 더 선호한다. 그다음은 절대 모멘텀과 같은 추세 추종 방법을 대하는 일부 사람들의 회의적인 태도다. 더욱이 듀얼 모멘텀 투자의 혜택을 제대로 이해하고 평가하려면 일정한 시간과 노력을 들여야 한다\n\n\n윌리엄 그로브 등에 따르면 “인간은 임상적 의사결정을 할 때 많은 오류를 범하기 쉽다. 기저율(base rate)을 무시하거나, 최적화되지 않은 가중을 단서에 부여하거나, 평균 회귀를 염두에 두지 않거나, 공분산을 제대로 추정하지 못하거나 하는 등의 오류가 여기에 속한다”.\n\n\n짐 사이먼스는 이렇게 말한다. “모형을 이용해 트레이딩하기로 했으면 그저 노예처럼 모형만 이용해야 한다. 지금은 모형이 아무리 똑똑하거나 멍청하게 여겨지더라도, 무슨 일이 있어도 절대로 시키는 대로만 해야 한다.”\n\n\n리처드 드리하우스의 말을 빌리면 “주식시장은 여자와 같다. 지켜본다. 반응한다. 그리고 존중한다”.\n\n\n빅토르 위고(Victor Hugo)의 말을 빌리면 “여러 가지로 미래를 표현할 수 있다. 미래란 약한 자에게는 도달할 수 없는 것이고, 두려워하는 자에게는 미지의 것이며, 용감한 자에게는 기회다”.\n\n\n과거 데이터와 수익률이 향후 실적을 보장할 것이라고 기대하면 안 된다.\n\n\n절대 모멘텀은 간단하고 롱온리 방식의 투자가가 선호하는 장점이 많다. 절대 모멘텀을 모든 자산이나 자산 포트폴리오에 적용하면 포트폴리오에 포함한 자산군의 기여도를 유지할 수 있다.\n\n\n상대 모멘텀은 일부 자산을 포트폴리오에서 배제하거나 축소해야 하는 단점이 있다. 이를 통해 다수 자산군 분산투자의 장점 일부를 상실할 수 있고, 과거 수익은 낮았으나 갑자기 초과수익을 기록하는 자산을 포트폴리오에서 배제함으로써 수익 기회를 놓칠 수 있다.\n\n\n절대 모멘텀의 두 번째 장점은 시장 체제(regime) 변화를 식별해서 하락 변동성을 줄이는 능력이다. 절대 모멘텀과 상대 모멘텀 모두 수익률을 개선할 수 있지만, 롱온리 방식의 투자에서 불가피한 대폭락을 피하는 능력은 절대 모멘텀에만 존재한다.\n\n\n금융시장은 불안정하게 변동하고, 수익 분포는 자기상관성과 상호 의존성이 높다. 따라서 견고하고 비모수적인 방법으로 분석 및 비교하는 것이 가장 좋다.\n\n\n이런 방법 중 하나는 2차 확률 우위(second-order stochastic dominance)인데, 기댓값이 동일하거나 높고 예측성이 높은(위험이 적은) 결과 세트를 선호하는 방법이다.\n\n\n절대 모멘텀으로 추세를 측정하면 하방 위험이 줄어들고, 시장 체제가 유지될 경우 혜택을 얻으며, 장기적으로 더 높은 위험조정수익률을 달성할 수 있다.\n\n\n모든 투자자는 절대 모멘텀을 연구하는 것이 좋을 것이다. 이 논문에서 소개한 간단한 방법만 활용해도 절대 모멘텀이 자체로 매력적인 전략임을 확인할 수 있고, 모든 자산과 포트폴리오의 위험조정수익률을 개선하기 때문이다.\n\n\n나는 금융상품 대부분을 믿지 않는다. 상품을 만든 금융회사는 수수료가 목적이지, 고객의 수익은 안중에 없기 때문이다.\n\n\n기본적으로 듀얼 모멘텀은 장기적으로 우상향하는 자산만 있으면 ‘무엇을 섞어도’ 되는 신기한 전략이다.\n\n\n모든 시장의 움직임에는 ‘추세’가 존재합니다. 그래서 역설적으로 비쌀 때 사서 싸게 파는 전략이 진정한 의미에서 ‘싸게 사서 비싸게 파는’ 전략입니다. 왜냐하면 비쌀 때 사면(오를 때 사면) 가격이 더 비싸지는(더 오르는) 속성이 있고, 가격이 싸질 때 사면(떨어질 때 사면) 가격이 더 싸지는(더 하락하는) 속성이 있기 때문입니다. 투자에서 ’싸다’와 ’비싸다’는 상대적인 의미로 접근해야 하는데 많은 투자자들이 이 개념을 오해하고 있습니다.\n\n\n저는 제 책에서 이렇게 주장했습니다. “첫째, 나는 절대로 워런 버핏을 이길 수 없다, 둘째, 경험상 체계적인 의사결정 과정과 건전한 투자철학을 결합하면 시간이 지남에 따라 부를 쌓아 올릴 수 있다.” 마찬가지로 그의 책을 보며 드는 생각은 다음과 같습니다. “첫째, 나는 절대로 이렇게 명쾌하게 책을 쓸 수 없다, 둘째, 모멘텀 투자는 가치투자 못지않은 제1의 시장 이례 현상이다.”\n\n\n기업의 펀더멘털이야말로 주가를 움직이는 가장 근본적이고 강력한 모멘텀이라는 말씀을 덧붙입니다. 내재가치를 고려해 스크리닝한 우량주를 대상으로 하거나, 듀얼 모멘텀에 내재가치와 관련된 지표를 추가 결합해 트리플 모멘텀(triple momentum)을 시도하면 더 바람직합니다.\n\n\n“이거 재미난데! 한번 해보자”라면서 적극적으로 도전하길 바랍니다. 적극적인 사람은 ‘한계’가 없고, 소극적인 사람은 ‘한 게’ 없다고 하지 않던가요. 또 어쩌면 이미 잘 알고 있는 내용일지도 모릅니다. 그렇지만 실제로 해보지 않았다면 이 책을 계기로 도전해보기 바랍니다. 영화 「매트릭스(The Matrix)」(1999)에서 모피어스(Morpheus)는 이렇게 말했습니다. “길을 아는 것과 그 길을 걷는 것은 다르다.”\n\n\n조지 산타야나(George Santayana)가 말했듯이, 역사에서 배우지 못하는 사람은 역사를 반복하기 마련이다.\n\n\n워런 버핏의 멘토였던 벤저민 그레이엄의 말을 빌리면, “투자자에게 최대의 문제이자 최악의 적은 아마도 자기 자신일 것이다”."

Taking a traditional long-only equity position may be a more efficient way to achieve a comparable beta exposure."

Compared to other hedge fund strategies, expectations of return for short strategies tend to be lower. Compared to L/S equity hedge funds with their balanced beta exposure, short strategy funds tend to have ****greater volatility.\n\n\nStrategy implementation\nHedge fund managers go “short” a security by borrowing the security, selling it at the current market price, and then (ideally) profit by repurchasing the same security later at a lower price in order to return it to the lender.\nThe most challenging part of profiting from shorting stocks is finding securities that are going to lose value. Managers use a bottom-up approach to identify firms with unprofitable business models, bad management, too much debt, or even shady accounting.\nA dedicated short seller takes on no long stock exposure; rather, they carefully select stocks for a pure short exposure, typically 60%-120%. A dedicated short manager who wishes to temper the fund’s market exposure will typically do this by holding cash.\nShort-biased managers have a similar strategy; however, they may also take on some long exposure, while remaining net short, often 30%-60% net short.\nFor both dedicated short sellers and short-biased managers, relatively little leverage is used.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nThe primary goal of dedicated short-selling and short-biased funds is to produce returns that are uncorrelated (or negatively correlated) with the return or conventional portfolio assets. When successful, these negative correlations provide tremendous benefit to a portfolio.\nHowever, this goal of negative correlation comes at a cost; expected returns for short strategies are relatively low. Historical performance of short strategies suggests that these strategies have produced returns that are unreliable and often underwhelming."

One way to view merger arbitrage is to compare it to writing insurance on an acquisition. If the acquisition is completed as planned, the hedge fund earns an insurance premium. If the transaction fails, however, then the hedge fund stands to lose money, analogous to an insurance company making a payout.\n\nMerger arbitrage traits\n\ntarget price 상승 이유 - 경영권 premium / acquirer price 하락 이유 - dividend 대신 투자 + dilution 발생\nhostile M&A가 friendly M&A보다 성공 가능성 낮음\nUS Data\n\n성공률 70 ~ 90%\nreturn spread 3% ~ 7%\ndeal time 3-4 months\nnet return 7 ~ 12%\n\nCorporate event - binary model (0 아니면 1)\n\n\n\nStrategy add\n\ntrue source of return - alpha from deal closing\nrisk management 방식\n\ntarget CB 매입 - target price 상승 시 return 증가 / target price 하락 시 bond 유지\ntarget CDS short - 딜 성공 시 CDS premium 하락 → 수익 실현\nequity index ETF or futures 사용 가능\ntarget long position hedge\n\nlong OTM put option\n\nacquirer short position hedge\n\nlong OTM call option\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\nIn the case of a merger deal that fails, the price movements that originally occurred when the merger was announced will reverse: the price of the target will fall, and the price of the acquirer will rise. A hedge fund that had taken a position based on the merger succeeding is likely to suffer a significant cost when the deal fails unexpectedly; possibly in the order of a 40% loss. This kind of potential outcome gives merger arbitrage significant left-tail risk.\nCompared to typical hedge fund strategies, merger arbitrage is more liquid. (대부분 public corporate)\n\n\nStrategy implementation\nIn the most common merger arbitrage scenario, the portfolio manager takes positions in the securities of the companies involved, with the expectation of successful deal.\nLess often, the hedge fund manager may have the opinion that the merger will fail (for example, the deal might be blocked by the government because it would stifle competition.) In this scenario, the fund would take the opposite position to those.\nIn order to generate a worthwhile level of return, hedge funds pursuing a merger arbitrage strategy will typically apply 300%-500% leverage in order to achieve low-double-digit returns. (high leverage)\nOne specific variety of merger arbitrage involves cross-border mergers and acquisitions (M&A) where two countries are two regulatory authorities are involved. Such mergers are seen as more risky.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nThe Sharpe ratios of merger arbitrage strategies tend to be high, as these strategies usually produce relatively steady returns. However, on top of these steady returns is significant left-tail risk."

Firms may find themselves in this position for a number of reasons, including too much leverage, difficulty competing in their sector, or accounting issues. The securities of such a firm will often trade at greatly depressed prices.\nCompounding the discounting of the securities of distressed firms is the fact that institutions such as insurance companies and banks are often not permitted to hold non-investment-grade securities. The selling of such securities can create significant pricing inefficiencies and can open up opportunities for hedge funds seeking profit.\nAs an alternative to liquidation, a firm may instead be able to reorganize, which may involve renegotiating the company’s liabilities.

    "text": "Fixed-Income arbitrage\nThe idea behind fixed-income arbitrage strategies is to take advantage of temporary mispricing of fixed-income instruments, by going long comparatively undervalued securities, and going short comparatively overvalued securities. Idiosyncrasies that might be exploited include yield curve kinks or anticipated changes in the shape of the yield curve.\nThe securities may be fixed-income instruments of many types, including consumer debt, bank loans, corporate bonds, or sovereign bonds. Hedge fund managers take positions in these securities under the assumption that prices will revert toward their fair values. (mean reversion)\nFixed-income arbitrage strategies often make use of significant leverage, in pursuit of sufficient levels of return.\n\nFixed-income investment traits\n\nvaluation difference source\n\ncredit quality difference - investment grade / non-investment grade\nliquidity difference - on-the-run / off-the-run\nvolatility difference - security with embedded option\n\ninterest rate risk hedge 방법\n\nduration neutral position, but government debt sovereign risk와 ABS/MBS의 credit/prepayment risk는 통제가 어려움\n\n특이한 risk point\n\nmortgage 관련 채권 → negative convexity, underlying default rate\noff-the-run bond - pricing 왜곡 현상\nmunicipal bond / 일부 회사채 - liquidity issue 존재\n\n\n\n\nStrategy implementation\n\nYield curve trades - In this strategy, the hedge fund manager has a view of how the shape of the yield curve will evolve over time based on macroeconomic forecasts. The portfolio manager makes long and short investments in fixed-income instruments in order to profit from the anticipated yield curve steepening or flattening. As usual, the portfolio manager will profit when the prices of the long securities rise and the prices of the short securities fall. If the positions taken are in securities of different firms, then liquidity, credit, and interest rate risks will be present. For positions in securities of the same issuer, interest rate movements would be the main source of risk.\nCarry trades - In a carry trade, the portfolio manager shorts a low-yielding security and goes long a high-yielding security. The source of return here is twofold; first, from the yield different, and second from the price changes as mean reversion occurs.\n\nBecause fixed-income securities tend to be priced fairly efficiently, the amount of profit that can be earned by fixed-income arbitrage is somewhat limited. As a result, substantial leverage is often applied to fixed-income arbitrage strategies. (400% leverage is not uncommon; even 1500% leverage is not unheard of.)\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\nGenerally, the return to fixed-income arbitrage strategies are relatively small, so significant levels of leverage are used to increase the amount of return.\nThe liquidity of fixed-income arbitrage depends on the particular strategy employed and the kinds of fixed income instruments used. Strategies involving U.S. Treasuries are very liquid, while strategies that make use of mortgage-backed securities or foreign instruments, for example, are less liquid.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nReturn distributions for a fixed income arbitrageurs tend to be similar to writing puts. If the trade unfolds as expected, the investor will earn a return from the spread narrowing, plus a return from positive carry. However, if the spread between the two instruments widens unexpectedly, the return to the investor may become quite negative.\nOne drawback to fixed income arbitrage strategies is that their highly leveraged nature can cause modest price volatility to lead to domino effect of margin calls and deleveraging. For example, the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 and the Russian Ruble Crisis of 1998 led to the collapse of the renowned hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management."

    "text": "Convertible bond arbitrage\nConvertible bonds are fixed-income debt securities that make regular coupon payments but can additionally be exchanged for a prearranged number of common stock shares. The bond-to-stock conversion is at the bondholder’s discretion, though it is only permitted at certain point in the bond’s life.\nOne way to view convertible bonds is as a regular bond plus a long call option on the corresponding stock.\nAnalyzing convertible bonds is extremely complex due to impacts from a number of factors.\nThe primary goal of convertible bond arbitrage strategies is generally to profit from purchasing the implied volatility of convertible bonds, which is often underpriced. To do this without taking on excess risk, convertible bond arbitrageurs will take on other positions to try to hedge out the delta and gamma risk of the convertible bond holdings.\n\nCB arbitrage traits\n\nsporadically issued\nrelatively small size corporate\nthinly traded\nfewer covenant than straight bond\n\n\n\n핵심 issue\n\nCB에 있는 relatively cheap embedded option을 구분해서 투자하는 것\n\n그러기 위해 해야 하는 것 → 다른 risk 제거\ninterest rate risk - interest rate derivatives\ncredit risk - CDS\nmarket risk - delta 비율 조정 using equity short, put long\n\n어떤 방식을 쓰느냐에 따라 CB arbitrage style이 달라짐\n\n\n\nManager가 profit을 먹는 경우\n\nsufficient large stock price swing & proper periodic rebalancing\nrelative equity volatility > implied volatility of embedded option (conversion option)\n\n\n\nCB arbitrage를 걱정하게 만드는 상황\n\nshort squeeze - 대주 반환 request\ncredit issue - mismatch too wide or too narrow\ntime decay of embedded option\n\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\nConvertible bond arbitrage managers encounter two primary sources of liquidity issues; first, because the strategy requires the manager to borrow and then short sell the underlying equity and second, because the fixed income instruments being invested in are often complex niche products.\n\n\nStrategy implementation\nConvertible arbitrage strategies generally exploit the fact that the options within convertible instruments usually exhibit low implied volatilities when compared to the historical volatilities of the equities that underlie the option. The challenge for the convertible bond arbitrage manager that invests in these convertibles is to hedge away the other sources of risk that are embedded in the convertible security including market risk, interest rate risk, and the credit risk of the bond issuer.\nWhen a convertible bond’s current conversion value is well below the convertible bond price, the out-of-the-money convertible bond will behave much like a straight bond. Conversely, when a convertible bond’s conversion value is above the convertible bond price, the in-the-money call makes the convertible behave much like the corresponding stock.\nSignificant amounts of leverage are usually used to implement convertible bond strategies, often combining a three times long bond exposure with a two times short equity exposure.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nConvertible arbitrage strategies perform best during periods of normal market conditions, when liquidity is available, when volatility is modest, and when there is a good selection of convertible bonds being issued. Convertible arbitrage may not perform well in period of illiquidity or weak credit."

Rather than being focused on individual securities, these strategies take a top-down approach to make macro investments on a global basis across regions, sectors, and asset classes.\nThe returns of opportunistic hedge fund strategies are generally impacted by market cycles, global developments, and international interactions. The risks will depend on the particular strategy and asset class involved.\nThe implementation of opportunistic hedge fund strategies can be based on a number of broad techniques. Technical analysis uses past price changes to forecast future price movements. Strategic based on fundamentals, on the other hand, attempt to analyze security prices, markets, sectors, and the relationships between markets, using economic data as the input.\nManagers using a systematic implementation of their strategies use computer algorithms and rules to determine which trades to make.

As a result, the returns of global macro funds tend to be uneven and volatile.\n\n\nStrategy implementation\nGlobal macro strategies tend to be based on top-down analysis beginning with scrutiny of the global economy, then macro trends within economies, and so on, in order to identify potential opportunities.\nDifferent global macro managers are likely to implement their strategies using very different techniques; for example, technical analysis vs. fundamental analysis, or discretionary implementation versus systematic implementation.\nOne commonality between global macro funds is that most tend to apply leverage, often representing 600% or 700% of fund assets.\nA manager making directional predictions will generally use fundamental information to determine whether a particular asset is undervalued or overvalued on a historical basis. On the other hand, a manager using a relative value strategy will seek out securities that are overvalued or undervalued compared to one another.\nGlobal macro managers tend to use discretionary approaches more than managed futures managers.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nWhen added to a portfolio of traditional assets, a global macro hedge fund can bring a significant benefit (not only alpha, but also portfolio diversification).\nA successful global macro manager will anticipate changes before other market participants and will then invest in a position and with for the rest of the market to come around. This contrarian tendency can make an allocation to global macro strategies especially useful. For example, some global macro managers anticipated the United States’ subprime mortgage crisis well before the housing bubble began to collapse in 2007.\nDuring times of market stress, global macro funds have historically delivered right-tail skewed returns, which is extremely beneficial from a portfolio diversification perspective. However, this behavior cannot always be relied upon as such diversifying outcomes are not always realized."

    "text": "Managed futures\nHedge fund portfolio managers that pursue a managed futures strategy take long and short positions in a variety of derivatives contracts including futures, forwards, options on futures, swaps, and sometimes currencies and commodities.\nManaged futures strategies can be as simple as trading index futures on a particular sector, or it can involve very exotic contracts such as futures on the weather.\n\nManaged futures traits\n\ncyclicality\n\nLehman 사태 시 수익성 양호 - high-volatility 시장에서 positive skewness\nbut 이후 2011 ~ 2018 (mean-reverting market)에서 수익성 악화\n\n\n\n\nManaged futures keywords\n\npattern recognition trigger\ncrowding aspect / execution slippage\nsystematic approach\nright tail skewness (positive skewness)\ncyclical\nLehman 사태 때 상승, 안정 상황 때 하락\n\n\n\n전략이 성공하려면\n\nconsistent approach\navoid overfitting of model\ngoal - perform well in a future out-of-sample period (실제 상황)\n\nback-testing (과거 상황)\n\n\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\nManaged futures funds do not buy and sell assets; rather, they enter into futures contracts in order to gain the desired exposures.\nBecause of the mechanics of futures contracts (requiring only a small amount of upfront collateral), managed futures funds can easily apply great amounts of leverage. Typically, a fund will use perhaps 1/8 of its capital as collateral on futures contracts. The only 7/8 or so will be invested in some highly liquid security (such as short-term government bonds) that will serve as collateral for the futures clearinghouse.\nManaged futures funds are extremely liquid. The reason for this is that futures contracts themselves are highly liquid; they trade globally and continuously.\nOne downside of the popularity of managed futures strategies is that crowding has occurred. Many market participants pursue the same trades and use similar signals, and execution slippage sometimes occurs.\n\n\nStrategy implementation\nTime-series momentum (TSM)\n\n대세상승 long, 대세하락 short → net long/short equity position\n\nTSM trend following, portfolio managers simply follow momentum. They buy securities that have been rising in price and sell securities that have been falling.\nCross-sectional momentum (CSM)\n\n상승폭 상위종목 long, 하락폭 상위종목 short → net zero beta\n\nCSM strategies, which is carried out within a particular asset class (a cross section of assets). Again, the securities rising fastest are purchased and falling securities are shorted.\nThe high liquidity of futures contracts allow hedge fund managers to pursue a very wide selection of trading strategies. Generally, portfolio managers will rely on a signal trigger, most often based on volatility or momentum, to prompt the manager to trade.\nIn addition to using signals to indicate when to enter a trade, portfolio managers will also have rules for closing a position. Exit methodologies can be based on:\n\nprice target\nmomentum reversal\ntime\ntrailing stop-loss\nsome combination of these approaches\n\nThe goal of managed futures strategies is to develop rules and signals that work well not only on historical data but also in real-world use. However, the more portfolio managers are suing similar signals, the less effective signals will become.\nThe size of positions taken are usually based on factors such as correlation and volatility.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nPerhaps the most appealing feature of manage futures is their interaction with other investments. Overall, managed futures have very little correlation with traditional equity and fixed-income assets. The result is that when added to a portfolio, managed futures will generally improve the total risk-adjusted return.\nThis diversifying characteristics has proven its worth during times of market stress. While other strategies exhibit negative skewness during such period, the positive right-tail skewness of managed futures provide a significant advantage."

    "text": "Volatility trading\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nOnce an esoteric pursuit, volatility trading has evolved ever recent years to become a recognized investable asset.\nVolatility trading hedge fund managers will trade volatility-related assets globally, across countries and cross asset classes, in order to exploit perceived differences in volatility pricing. The overall goal is to purchase underpriced volatility and sell overpriced volatility.\nAnother volatility trade is to act as the counterparty to market participants that consistently seek long volatility. Because the negative correlation between stock market returns and equity volatility is high, equity investors seek to buy volatility as a hedge. (Equity long + volatility long) A hedge fund that is willing to sell volatility will earn an insurance-like premium as compensation for taking on this risk; however, such a strategy can unravel in a dramatic fashion.\nIn the U.S. markets, the most common volatility futures are contracts on the VIX index, which tracks the 30-day implied volatility of the S&P 500 index. VIX contracts tend to be mean reverting because high volatility naturally tends to dissipate over time.\n\nVolatility trading example\n\nJapanese Yen\nAsian timezone volatility < western timezone volatility → relative value volatility trading\nNikkei 225 implied volatility < S&P 500 implied volatility → cross-asset volatility trading\nCorrelation between Equity volatility and Equity market return → negatively correlated (-0.8) → long volatility → hedge against long equity\n\n\n\nStrategy implementation\nHedge fund managers wishing to pursue volatility trading have several options.\nOne possibility is to build various option strategies, such as straddle, calendar spreads, bull spreads, or bear spreads, using basic exchange-traded options.\nA second possibility is to make use of over-the-counter (OTC) options, which are customized to meet the portfolio manager’s specific needs. A drawback of this method, however, is that it introduces counterparty risk plus additional liquidity issues.\nA more direct way to trade volatility is to use futures on the VIX index. An advantage of this method is that it is a very direct way to express a view on volatility, without the need for hedging. There are disadvantages though. first, the mean-revering nature of the VIX index’s price and second, many traders and investors crowd into the VIX futures in order to sell volatility and capture the associated premiums, making it difficult to profit from that strategy.\nA fourth method of implementing a volatility trading strategy is to enter into an OTC volatility swap or alternatively a variance swap. (volatility trading) These derivatives provide a relatively pure exposure to volatility. (Note that the name “swap” there is somewhat misleading. Volatility swaps and variance swaps are actually forward contracts with a payoff based on the difference between observed or realized variance multiplied by some notional amount).\n\n\nInvestable characteristics\nThe investment characteristics of volatility trading will vary depending on the securities invested in and the positions taken.\nInvestors that take a short position in volatility will earn premiums and generally produce stable returns under average market conditions. A long position in volatility will display positive convexity, which can be valuable as a hedge.\nThe liquidity of a volatility trading strategy will depend on the instruments used. Futures and options based on VIX tend to be extremely liquid, and exchange-traded volatility options are liquid as well (especially when the tenor is short). OTC contracts on the other hand are generally less liquid.\nThe use of futures contracts makes it easy to apply leverage to a volatility trading strategy. The convexity of volatility derivatives means that sometimes large gains can be made from long volatility strategies while taking little risk.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nIn a portfolio, a long volatility strategy is a potent diversifiers, because stock market volatility is highly negatively correlated with market returns. The downside of maintaining a long volatility position, however, is that a premium must be paid to the volatility seller."

    "section": "Reinsurance/life settlements",
    "text": "Reinsurance/life settlements\nIn recent years, numerous hedge funds have formed to take advantage of attractive investment opportunities related to insurance policies. In a typical life settlement transaction, an insured person will sell (generally through a broker) their insurance policy to a hedge fund. After the investor pays the insured for the policy, the hedge fund then will be liable for the premium payments and will also receive the death benefit upon the passing of the insured.\nIndividuals will sell their life insurance contracts when they feel that they no longer benefit from the agreements. Individuals who purchased life insurance policies are incentivized to sell their policies to third-party brokers because those firms will oftentimes pay more for the policy than the issuing insurance company will pay for a surrendered policy. (Cash Surrender Value, CSV)\nCatastrophe risk reinsurance is another area where hedge funds are increasingly investing. Catastrophe insurance covers the holder against earthquakes, tornadoes, hurricanes, floods, and the like. In order to diversify and decrease risk, insurance companies in their normal course of business will sell off some of their risk to reinsurance companies, who may then lay these risks off on hedge funds in exchange for capital. Reinsurance can be a rewarding investment for a hedge fund if sufficient diversity can be obtained. (e.g., vary by geography and types of insurance) if the insurance company provides sufficient loan loss reserves and if the policy premiums are adequate. When considering an investment in catastrophic insurance, the hedge fund considers both typical and worst-case outcomes and compares this to the insurance premiums to be received. Geographic diversity is important, as a specific catastrophic event will tend to affect only a particular part of the world.\n\nInvestment characteristics\nStrategies that involve investments in insurance contracts are illiquid, because insurance policies are somewhat difficult to sell after initiation.\n\n\nStrategy implementation\nThe term “life settlement” refers to a secondary market transaction on an insurance policy. A hedge fund that invests in life settlements will analyze various pools of life insurance contracts that brokers offer, and invest in the ones that are predicted to offer an attractive return. After investing, the hedge fund then becomes the beneficiary of these contracts. The investment is successful if the present value of the future insurance payout exceeds the payments made by the hedge fund.\nIn selecting which insurance policies to invest in, a hedge fund will seek out policies with the following characteristics:\n\nthe purchase price of the policy is low\nthe ongoing premium payments are low\nthe insured person is likely to die relatively soon\n\nOne major prerequisite to profiting from life settlements is to develop an accurate alternative estimate of life expectancies. Appraising a life settlement requires a significant amount of skill and knowledge and requires comparing individual policy holders’ outlooks to actuarial averages.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nA very appealing feature of insurance investments in a portfolio is that the risk inherent in these strategies is almost entirely uncorrelated with market risks and business cycles. For example, floods and earthquakes have little or no correlation to the financial markets.\nThus, hedge funds that invest in such assets can add alpha to a portfolio while simultaneously adding return diversification."

(Though over time, these FoF fees have become negotiable and generally smaller.)\n\n2/20 or 1/20 + double fee structure\n\nOne important feature that FoF serve is making an investment in hedge funds practical for smaller investors, such as small institutions and for moderately wealthy individuals. FoF serve as an entry point into hedge fund investing.\n\ngood for small investors\n\nAside from providing an accessible path into hedge funds, FoF provide a number of other advantages. For example, FoF may provide access to high-profile managers whose funds are otherwise closed to new investors. Also the larger size of FoF may allow the fund to obtain valuable concessions from the underlying funds’ management. (side letter → fee negotiation)\nLiquidity can be a challenge for portfolio managers of funds-of-funds. Typically,  a FoF will require a one-year initial lock-up for investors then will allow somewhat greater liquidity afterwards (e.g., monthly or quarterly redemption). However, the underlying funds may have even stricter limits on liquidity, leaving a FoF manager in a potential squeeze. (FoF squeeze)\nAnother drawback of funds-of-funds relates to potential netting risk, whereby investors could be required to make significant incentive payments to successful underlying funds, even if the overall performance of a FoF is poor.

In addition to this strategic allocation is a tactical allocation, whereby the FoF manager will at various times underweight or overweight the various hedge fund strategies to reflect the FoF manager’s perception of a changing market environment.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\n\nGreater diversification\nSteady returns\nless concentrated exposure to risks\nless volatility\nless exposure to the downside risk of any individual fund manager"

Because each of the multi-strategy funds are managed in-house, it is relatively easy for the multi-strategy manager to reallocate investment from one strategy to another.\nInvestor fees for a multi-strategy fund are often more attractive than those of a FoF. While FoF investors are subject to netting risk (where hefty performance fees can be paid to some sub-fund managers, despite overall poor FoF performance), multi-strategy funds are more likely to absorb this netting risk internally.\nLike a FoF, multi-strategy funds generally limit investor liquidity using redemption periods and initial lock-ups.\n\n\nStrategy implementation\nMulti-strategy funds carry out their approach by making investments in a number of varying hedge fund strategies.\nOne key advantage of multi-strategy funds is their ability to make tactical reallocations in addition to a fund’s strategic allocation. Furthermore, the multi-strategy fund’s internal teams are likely to be well informed about why and when capital and leverage should be reallocate, versus a FoF manager for whom the various funds are more opaque. (Coordination is good)\nRisk management can also be more effective with a multi-strategy fund. Unlike FoF managers, multi-strategy managers should have an excellent view of correlations and common risks between the various funds.\nMulti-strategy funds also enjoy efficiencies that come from multiple hedge fund teams sharing the same administrative resources.\nMulti-strategy funds often will make greater use of leverage than the average FoF. Normally, leverage in multi-strategy funds does not pose much of a risk; however, during periods of market stress, small sources of danger can become significant left-tail risks that threaten the survival of the fund. (This kind of scenario lead to the demise of Ritchie Capital in 2005 and Amaranth Advisors in 2006.)\nMulti-strategy funds generally have more varied performance than a FoF.\n\n\nRole in a portfolio\nMulti-strategy funds are intended to improve an investment portfolio by adding diversification and steady, low-volatility returns.\nHistorically, multi-strategy funds have generally performed better than have funds-of-funds, due to a superior fee structure and greater ability to execute on tactical asset allocation. However, the leveraged nature of multi-strategy funds can sometimes lead to a left-tail blow-up during times of stress."

Because of the left-tail risk present in many hedge fund strategies, the Sortino ratio is generally seen as a superior measure of the risk-adjusted performance of hedge funds.\nWhen 20% allocations to various hedge fund strategies are added to the traditional stock/bond portfolio, notably high Sharpe ratios are also achieved from allocations to these strategies:\n\nSystematic futures hedge funds\nDistressed securities\nFixed-income arbitrage\nglobal macro\nequity market neutral\n\nThe highest Sortino ratios were attained via allocations to the following hedge fund strategies:\n\nEquity market neutral\nsystematic futures\nL/S equity\nevent driven\n\nAllocations to the following strategies was found to be effective in generating superior risk-adjusted performance, based on the comparatively higher Sharpe and Sortino ratios:\n\nsystematic futures\nequity market neutral\nglobal macro\nevent-driven hedge fund strategies\n\nOn the other hand, it was observed that the following fund strategies do not significantly enhance risk-adjusted performance:\n\nfund-of-funds\nmulti-strategy\n\nWhile all of the hedge fund strategies expose the overall portfolio to various kinds of additional portfolio risks, allocating a portion of a stock/bond portfolio to hedge funds generally reduces risk and increases returns."

    "text": "Investment vehicles\nA typical structure for an alternative investment vehicle is a limited partnership. The investment manager is the general partner and investors in the fund are limited partners. With this structure, the liability of investors in the fund is limited to the amount they have committed. Often these limited partnerships are registered offshore for tax or reporting reasons.\nFor investors that lack the needed expertise, investing through a fund-of-funds may be appropriate. A fund-of-funds manager can pool capital from investors and use it to invest in limited partnerships. Typically, a fund-of-funds manager will specialize in a particular subset of alternative investment strategies. The benefit of a fund-of-funds is that it provides access to this asset class to investors who otherwise would not have it. The drawback is that they charge an additional layer of fees above those charged by the underlying limited partnerships.\nSome investors that are large enough to demand favorable investment terms may establish separately managed accounts (SMAs) through which to access alternative investments. SMAs have requirements for both the investor and the fund manager that can make them challenging to implement. Another approach is to establish a limited partnership with a single client, known as a fund of one. A risk with SMAs or funs of one is that general partners, when allocating certain investment opportunities to investors, may favor limited partners who are paying the fund’s standard fees.\n\nsingle LP fund\n\nSome open-ended mutual funds and “undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities” (UCITS) have developed to give smaller investors access to alternative investments. However, these structures are more regulated than the other investment vehicles and may constrain managers’ choice of strategies. As a result, returns on investments through these structures might not achieve the returns realized by the asset class as a whole.\n\n거래가능유가증권 집단투자방식"

    "text": "Liquidity concerns\nunderlying asset\n\nstrict closed-end\nlow liquidity → call provision, investment horizon\nno redemption\n\nBoth the investments structures and the underlying investments themselves contribute to liquidity risk.\nLimited partnerships for alternative investments are typically structured with subscription provisions for accepting capital, lock-up period, and restrictions on redemptions. Hedge funds, for example, may accept new capital quarterly or monthly, impose lock-up periods (often six months or a year) during which limited partners may not make redemptions or may do so only with a penalty, and offer redemptions on a quarterly or annual schedule as well as requiring a notice period prior to redemptions. They may also impose “gates” or maximum amounts that can be redeemed at any one time.\nInvestment structure\n\nsubscription agreement\nlock-up\nredemption\n\nprior notice\nredemption penalty\n\ngate = maximum redemption amount\n\nFor funds in the private equity, private credit, real estate, and real asset sectors, liquidity provisions are often more strict than is typical for hedge funds. Subscriptions are structured in “closes” for new investors, usually over a one-year period. Limited partners commit a stated amount of capital, and the general partner will “call” this capital over an investment period (such as 3 to 5 years) as they identify investment opportunities. Redemptions are typically not available. Instead, the fund will distribute capital over its life (often 10 to 12 years) as it exits its investments. A small secondary market exists for limited partnerships, but transactions often take place at significant discounts to funds’ net asset values and may require approval from the general partner.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\nCommitted capital이 전부 capital call이 안 될 수 있음 → return 왜곡 가능성\nCapital call / distribution timing의 불확실성 → return의 측정 어려움\nopportunity cost of committed capital\nliquidity - hedge fund의 redemption terms\n\nlong-biased hedge fund → liquidity good\nshort-biased hedge fund → liquidity bad\nside pocket\n\nredemption이 많으면 GP 운용력 저하\nilliquid investment가 늘면 → restrict redemption\nLeverage → margin call → LP에게 불리\nmarket turbulence가 오면 Prime Broker (liquidity provider)가 claim → portfolio에 bad egg만 남음\n\nA general partner is not required to call the full amount of committed capital. This is an important consideration when estimating expected returns on a portfolio allocation to alternative investments. A fund may achieve an impressive rate of return, but a limited partner is only earning the return on the portion of committed capital that has been called.\nNeither capital calls nor distributions occur on a predetermined schedule. Capital may be called (or not) at any time during the calldown period. Distributions can occur at any point in the fund’s life, even during the calldown period. This, too, affects how much of a portfolio’s allocation to alternative investments is actually invested at any point in time.\nWith respect to the liquidity of a fund’s holdings, a potential issue is whether they are consistent with the fund’s redemption terms. This is mostly a consideration for hedge funds; as noted previously, other types of private investment funds generally do not offer redemptions.\nHedge funds that pursue long-only equity strategies tend to hold relatively liquid investments that are consistent with offering redemptions monthly or quarterly. Short positions are less liquid, which can be a concern if funds that hold significant short positions also offer redemptions frequently. Investors should also note that general partners might designate some of a fund’s less liquid holding as not subject to the fund’s ordinary redemption terms. This is referred to as a “side pocket.” A fund’s redemption terms may be misleading if a large portion of its holdings are side pocketed.\nFrequent redemption periods may limit a general partner’s flexibility to implement strategies with long time horizons or infrequent investment opportunities, such as event-driven strategies. This is particularly true for distressed assets and is the reason funds specializing in those tend to be private equity partnerships rather than hedge funds.\nFunds that hold significant portions of illiquid investments, such as some relative value funds, may restrict redemptions under certain market conditions to avoid having to liquidate these assets during crisis periods. One effect of these restrictions is that during such periods, investors may demand redemptions from other hedge funds that have more liquid holdings.\nLeverage is another important liquidity consideration because creditors have priority of claims over limited partners. Margin calls may force a leveraged fund to sell its most liquid holdings and be left with its less liquid investments, regardless of which holding the general partner would otherwise prefer to keep."

    "text": "Expenses, fees, and taxes\nMany alternative investments involve significant fees and expenses, such as the “2 and 20” fee structure of many hedge funds (annual management fee 2% of assets under management, incentive fee 20% of gains). Administrative expenses of a fund may also be passed through to investors.\nFunds with calldown structures charge management fees on the amount of committed capital, regardless of how much of it has been called down. This may generate negative returns in the early years of an investment when much of the committed capital is yet to be called.\nInvestors must ensure that their investments, and the investment vehicles used to invest, are consistent with their tax situations. Some fund strategies may result in short-term taxable income to investors, or may be subject to tax withholding. Investors who need to estimate their annual income for tax reporting may find it difficult to do so given the unpredictable nature of returns from many alternative investments. Tax-exempt organizations must ensure that income from a fund will not be considered to be unrelated to the organization’s purpose, and therefore considered taxable."

    "text": "Intermediaries or in-house programs\n\nbuild or buy\nin-house or intermediary\n\nLarge investors may consider developing their own program for implementing alternative investments directly rather than using intermediaries such as funds of funds. An in-house program may be appropriate for an investor that needs highly customized solutions, desires close control over its investment program, or wishes to implement co-investments with general partners. The “build or buy” decision depends on whether the investor can produce similar results to those of an intermediary at lower cost or generate returns high enough to offset any costs in excess of the costs charged by an intermediary.\nA successful program must be able to identify and invest with the best fund managers. Even if an investor is expert at choosing managers who will generate top returns, those managers may attract more capital than they can invest productively, and therefore close their funds to new investors. Manager may also decline capital from investors whose public reporting requirements they feel would be inconsistent with their proprietary strategies.\nInvestors must also be able to perform due diligence on managers with whom they wish to invest. This requires access to their key decision makers, both before and during the life of an investment. Without this level of access, an investor may be left in a troubled fund when better-informed investors have already demanded redemptions."

A portfolio must be managed in a way that meets its capital commitments while still providing required liquidity.\nAn investor can develop forecasting models to help manage liquidity. Examples of liquidity modeling include projecting cash flows to and form a fund and forecasting the annual capital commitments needed to reach and maintain the targeted allocation to alternative investments.\n\\[\n\\text{percentage to be called in period t} \\times (\\text{committed capital} - \\text{capital previously called})\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{percentage to be distributed in period t} * [\\text{NAV in period (t - 1)} * (1 + \\text{growth rate})]\n\\]\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\\[\n\\text{NAV in period}_{t} = \\text{NAV in period}_{t - 1} \\times (1 + \\text{growth rate}) + \\text{contributions in period t} - \\text{distributions in period t}\n\\]\nUsing models such as these, an investor can estimate the cash flows to and from a fund. The investor should understand a model’s sensitivity to changes in model assumptions and how these affect cash flow forecasts.\nLiquidity forecasting is also important for managing how a portfolio reaches and maintains its target asset allocations. Take for example a $15 billion portfolio that currently has no investments in private equity but wants to have a 10% allocation to that asset class. This is unlikely to be achievable all at once (and even if it could be, the private equity investments would not be diversified across vintage years as they should).\nInstead, the allocation to private equity will need to increase toward its 10% target over a number of years. Importantly, that percentage will be based on the future values of both the overall portfolio and the private equity investments.\nCombined with the cash flow forecasting approach described previously for a particular fund, an investor can project the capital commitments needed over a span of years to reach the target allocation, and forecast the need to reinvest future distributions to maintain the target.\nA crucial aspect of liquidity planning is having cash available to meet capital calls. Keeping these amounts in cash equivalents has significant opportunity costs. A suggested approach is to invest it in publicly traded securities that may be viewed as proxies for the private investments to which they are committed. For example, capital committed to private real estate but not yet called could be invested in publicly traded real estate investment trusts.\nCapital calls, distributions, growth rates, and even fund lifetimes may turn out significantly different than expected. An investor should stress-test liquidity planning models against unexpected events such as delayed fund distributions when expected distributions have been earmarked to meet capital calls."

To set the size of any figure, you need only copy the same line of code as it appears. Then, if you’d like to use a custom size, change the provided values of 14 and 6 to the desired width and height.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006173716415\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006174434647\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006174458977\n\n\nannot=True - This ensures that the values for each cell appear on the chart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006175118494\n\n\nTo double-check the strength of this relationship, you might like to add a regression line, or the line that best fits the data. We do this by changing the command to sns.regplot.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006175125869\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006175155413\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006175219474\n\n\nWe’ll refer to this plot type as a categorical scatter plot, and we build it with the sns.swarmplot command.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006175244044\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006180210150\n\n\nWe customize the behavior of the command with two additional pieces of information:\n\na= chooses the column we’d like to plot (in this case, we chose 'Petal Length (cm)').\nkde=False is something we’ll always provide when creating a histogram, as leaving it out will create a slightly different plot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006180243443\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006180306571\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006180343444\n\n\nIn this case, the legend does not automatically appear on the plot. To force it to show (for any plot type), we can always use plt.legend().\n\n\n\nimage-20211006180401868\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nSince it’s not always easy to decide how to best tell the story behind your data, we’ve broken the chart types into three broad categories to help with this.\n\nTrends\n- A trend is defined as a pattern of change.\n\nsns.lineplot - Line charts are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group.\n\nRelationship\n- There are many different chart types that you can use to understand relationships between variables in your data.\n\nsns.barplot - Bar charts are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.\nsns.heatmap - Heatmaps can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers.\nsns.scatterplot - Scatter plots show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third categorical variable.\nsns.regplot - Including a regression line in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables.\nsns.lmplot - This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple, color-coded groups.\nsns.swarmplot - Categorical scatter plots show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.\n\nDistribution\n- We visualize distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are.\n\nsns.distplot - Histograms show the distribution of a single numerical variable.\nsns.kdeplot - KDE plots (or 2D KDE plots) show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable (or two numerical variables).\nsns.jointplot - This command is useful for simultaneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006181059400\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006181110176\n\n\nSeaborn has five different themes: (1)\"darkgrid\", (2)\"whitegrid\", (3)\"dark\", (4)\"white\", and (5)\"ticks\", and you need only use a command similar to the one in the code cell above (with the chosen theme filled in) to change it.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can access Kaggle Datasets by visiting the link below:\n\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets\n\nThe link will bring you to a webpage with a long list of datasets that you can use in your own projects."

There should be no riskless profit to be gained by a combination of a forward contract position with positions in other assets.\nThis principle assumes that (1) transactions costs are zero, (2) there are no restrictions on short sales or the use of short sale proceeds, and (3) both borrowing and lending can be done in unlimited amounts at the risk-free rate of interest.\nForward price = price that prevents profitable riskless arbitrage in frictionless markets"

Thus, the margin in the futures markets is a performance guarantee.\nMarking to market is the process of adjusting the margin balance in a futures account each day for the change in the value of the contract from the previous trading day, based on the settlement price.\nLike forward contracts, futures contracts have no value at contract initiation. Unlike forward contracts, futures contracts do not accumulate value changes over the term of the contract.

    "text": "Fixed-income mandates\nFixed-income investment mandates can be classified into two major types: liability-based mandates and total return mandates.\nLiability-based mandates are portfolio assets that are managed solely to meet expected future liability payouts. All asset cash flows are reinvested until paid out to meet the liabilities. This is often referred to as immunization. There are several forms and variations of immunization.\n\nCash-flow matching is the simplest form of immunization. The assets are selected so that cash flows occur when and in the size needed to meet the liability payouts.\nDuration matching matches the duration of the assets and liabilities so the two will fluctuate in a similar way as interest rates change, such that their ending values will remain matched.\nContingent immunization (CI) is a hybrid of active management and immunization.\n\nTotal return mandates do not seek to fund future liabilities but may target an absolute rate of return or, more commonly, seek to equal or outperform (relative return versus) a benchmark. (smart beta)\n\nPure indexing, which attempts to replicate the performance of a bond index. It targets zero active return and risk. Most pure bond indexing instead seeks to exactly match all the risk factors of the index (such as duration, credit or quality, sectors, and prepayment risks) while still allowing the manager some leeway on the individual bonds selected.\nEnhanced indexing allows some additional flexibility in constructing the portfolio and seeks to add some modest active return. Typically, duration (interest rate risk) is still matched to the index, but some risk mismatches such as modest over- or underweighting of sectors and quality are allowed.\nActive management allows much larger deviations from the risk factors of the index and seeks greater active return.\n\nEquity - 공격수 / fixed-income - 수비수\nfixed income - 금융시장에서 가장 비중이 큰 시장\n채권은 종류가 매우 다양함 (만기, 신용등급, 옵션 등) → illiquidity\nportfolio에 fixed income 편입 시 효과\n\ndiversification\n\nequity와 상관계수가 낮음, 분산효과 존재\ninvestment grade (US)는 investment grade (US)끼리 상관계수 높음\ninvestment grade (foreign)은 investment grade (US)와 상관계수 덜 높음 - 분산효과\nhigh yield는 investment grade와 상관계수가 낮음 - 분산효과\nhigh yield는 equity와 상관계수 높음 - 분산효과\n상관계수가 항상 stable 하지는 않음 (flight to quality, contagion effect가 일어날 때 모두가 안전자산 선호)\n그래도 일반적으로 bond는 equity보다 변동성이 적음 → portfolio risk 감소 기능\n\nregular Cash flow\n\nregular, predictable cashflow\n위의 기능으로 future obligation에 대비할 수 있음\n\ninflation hedge\n\nstandard fixed-coupon은 hedge 기능 없음\ninflation linked bonds - inflation에 연동되어 par 조정 → 자동으로 coupon 금액도 조정됨\nfloating coupon - inflation에 연동되어 coupon rate만 조정\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

duration measures a portfolio’s percentage sensitivity to a 1% change in credit spread.\nDuration times spread (DTS) is equal to spread duration multiplied by the bonds’ credit spread. This measure adjust spread duration to give a higher sensitivity to spread changes when spreads themselves are higher.\n\nFixed-income managers would use these measures just listed to actively manage a fixed-income portfolio as follows:\n\nA manager expecting interest rates to fall would increase the duration of their portfolio in order to increase the amount by which their bond prices rise.\nA manager who expects credit spreads to narrow would increase the spread duration of their portfolio in order to increase the amount by which their bond price rises.\nA manager can use relative value techniques to rank individual bonds based on valuation, issuer characteristics, and technical market conditions, so that they can select the best bond to reflect their market view."

Instead of using old prices, bond pricing is often based on matrix pricing. information is gathered on recent trades of bonds with similar features (maturity, quality, and coupon). The YTM of those trades is used to calculate the inferred market price of similar bonds.\nPortfolio construction. Buy-and-hold investors have less need for liquidity as they have no plans to sell the bonds; thus, they may prefer to select less liquid bonds in exchange for higher yield. In contrast, active investors and traders will prefer more liquid bonds, reasoning their active management strategies will generate additional return and compensate for lower initial yield."

    "text": "Effects of yield curve changes\n\nFor a large parallel increase in the curve, the immediate decrease in portfolio value will be less than the decrease in the PVL due to the positive convexity effect.\nFor a large parallel decrease in the curve, the immediate decrease in portfolio value will exceed the increase in the PVL due to the positive convexity effect.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe parallel shift analysis indicates that the duration (rather than cash flow) matching immunization strategy does have structural risk. The structural risk is due to creating portfolio duration with a different allocation of asset durations (L and H) versus the allocation of liability durations (M only).\nThe parallel shift analysis:\n\nIndicates that immunization can be described as zero replication. A single zero-coupon bond could have been used for a no-risk, perfect cash flow match.\nDoes not indicate the strategy is always structurally risk free.\nDoes indicate the parallel shift assumption is sufficient to lead the strategy to succeed-but it is not a necessary assumption because the strategy may still be successful in other conditions. It is sufficient, but not necessary.\n\nIf the curve either steepens or flattens, the analysis becomes more complex and the structural risk increases.\n\nSteepening twist: Yield L decreases while yield H increase relative to yield M. The portfolio market value will decrease because the decline in value of the longer duration bond will exceed the increase in the value of the shorter duration bond. PVA is now below PVL. That, by itself, does not indicate the strategy will fail. If portfolio IRR increases sufficiently, the required FV might still be reached. This indicates that a steepening curve may create structural risk.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\nFlattening twist: Yield L increases while yield H decrease relative to yield M. The portfolio market value will increase because the increase in value of the longer duration bond will exceed the decrease in the value of the shorter duration bond. PVA is now above PVL. That, by itself, does not indicate the strategy will succeed. This indicates that a flattening curve may create structural risk.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\nPositive butterfly twist: Yield L and H increase while yield M decreases. The portfolio market value will decrease as both yield L and H increase. PVL will increase as yield M decreases. PVA is now below PVL. That is certainly detrimental, but it is possible the strategy could succeed if the portfolio IRR increases enough versus the decreases in liability discount rate. This indicates that the positive butterfly may create significant structural risk.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\nNegative butterfly twist: Yield L and H decrease while yield M increases. The portfolio market value will increases as both yield L and H decrease. PVL will decrease as yield M increases. PVA is now clearly above PVL. That is certainly favorable, but does not guarantee the strategy will succeed if the portfolio IRR decreases too much in relation to the increase in liability discount rate. It again indicates the possibility of significant structural risk.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThis structural risk can be reduced by reducing the dispersion of asset cash flows around the liability cash flow.\n\nInitial portfolio market value (PVA) equals (or exceeds) PVL.\nPortfolio Macaulay duration matches the due date of the liability\ndata:image/svg+xml;supportsDarkMode=1;base64,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\nMinimize portfolio convexity\nRegularly rebalance the portfolio to maintain the duration match as time and yields change.\n\nMoney duration: The first two conditions of immunization can be combined by matching money duration of the assets and liability.

Extend the duration of the portfolio to be longer than that of the benchmark in order to earn higher returns, primarily through higher coupon income on longer-dated bonds.\nRolling down the yield curve. This strategy is based on the fact that, as time passes, the bond’s remaining maturity and duration decrease.\nThe manager will look to find a bond positioned next to a relatively steep portion on the curve such that as time passes and its yield declines, the bond will offer the greatest increase in price.\nRepo carry trade. A carry trade is just another form of leverage. Return is enhanced by borrowing at a lower rate to invest the funds in an asset that will generate a higher rate of return. In a stable upward-sloping curve, borrow at lower shorter-term rates to invest at higher longer-term rates.\n\nDerivatives-based static yield curve strategies include the following:\n\nLong futures positions. Futures contracts provide implicit leverage into fixed-income positions because investors are required only to fund margin payments to open positions, which are usually a small fraction of the exposure gained through the futures contract.\nReceive-fixed swap. By receiving the fixed leg and paying the floating leg [a short-term market reference rate (MRR)] under an interest rate swap, the active manager can synthetically increase the duration of the portfolio. A manager that receives the fixed leg increases their portfolio duration.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

A bearish manager would position their overall portfolio duration to be negative, such that the portfolio increases in value as rates rise. A manager that does not expect a change in the level of the curve would likely position their portfolio as duration neutral.\nA bull steepener is the view that short-term rates will fall by more than long-term rates. This might occur when central banks cut short-term rates during an economic contraction.\nA bear steepener is the view that long-term rates will rise by more than short-term rates.

    "text": "Divergent yield curve shape view-change in curvature\nIf a manager has the view that the curvature of the yield curve is likely to change, they can profit from this view by combining long and short positions in bullet and barbells (referred to as a butterfly strategy).\nIf the manager believes that curvature will increase, they think that medium-term rates will rise relative to short- and long-term rates. In this scenario, the manager should short sell a medium-term bullet and buy a barbell (”short the body and long the wings”). Conversely, if the manager believes that curvature will decrease, they think that medium-term rates will fall relative to short- and long-term rates.\nRecall that the curvature of the yield curve can

    "text": "Unhedged foreign bond position\nA manager who invests in a foreign currency bond will earn the return of the bond in the foreign currency, \\(R_{FC}\\), alongside returns due to changes in the exchange rate, \\(R_{FX}\\). These two return components compound together to give a total domestic return, \\(R_{DC}\\), given by the following:\n\\[\nR_{DC} = (1 + R_{FC})(1 + R_{FX}) - 1\n\\]\nA manager with several different foreign exposures should calculate the domestic returns, \\(R_{DC}\\), individually for each foreign market, then weight these returns according to each foreign market’s weight in the portfolio.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nA manager may choose to hedge their foreign currency exposure by selling the foreign currency forward, thereby locking in an exchange rate to convert the foreign funds back to their domestic currency.\nRecall the fundamental no-arbitrage principal of covered interest rate parity (CIRP), which implies that, in efficient markets, a manager that hedges a foreign currency by selling the foreign currency forward should not earn excess returns. CIRP states that high interest rate currencies should trade at a forward discount, so that when a manager sells high interest rate currencies forward to remove currency risk, the forward discount offsets the interest rate differential earned from holding the higher interest rate currency.\nRecall that, according to CIRP, the fair forward rate is related to the spot rate by adjusting for interest rate differentials over the period of length T as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{forward rate} = \\text{spot rate} \\times \\frac{(1 + r_{DC})^{T}}{(1 +

    "text": "Credit risk models\nThere are two major categories of credit risk models: structural models and reduced form models.\nStructural models assume POD to be driven by the likelihood of the future value of the assets of a borrower falling below the threshold that would trigger default. These models are often referred to as “distance to default” models because the models are assessing how far away from defaulting an issuer currently is in terms of the volatility of their assets. Examples of structural models include Moody’s Expected Default Frequency (EDF) and Bloomberg’s Default Risk (DRSK) models, which provide daily estimates of POD and implied fair credit spreads.\nReduced form models look for relationships between macroeconomic conditions and the individual characteristics of a borrower, such as financial ratios, to infer default intensity (or periodic POD) for a bond issuer.\nAn example of a reduced form model is Altman’s z-score, which uses key financial ratios of companies as inputs to a regression-based equation, the output of which is used to classify the issuer in terms of likelihood of subsequent default.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Top-down credit strategies\nThe top-down approach focuses on macro factors that are likely to affect the credit portfolio. Top-down managers may use this relationship to identify when to focus on HY versus IG.\nTop-down can also be used to identify sectors of the market most likely to improve (or deteriorate), and the manager can overweight (or underweight) those sectors.\nTop-down analysis may focus on historical patterns such as the credit cycle and credit spread changes.\nFor example, suppose real growth is very low, defaults are high, and OAS for HY bonds is well above average; there is no particular opportunity because the high spread is compensation for high default losses.\nThe top-down manager would likely vary the portfolio’s average credit rating upward to a higher (or downward to a lower) rating in anticipation of weaker (or stronger) than consensus expectations for economic growth. The manager should consider how the portfolio’s average quality is calculated."

For illiquid bonds that trade infrequently, matrix pricing (or evaluated pricing) is often used, which estimates fair value through reference to the yields and prices of similar actively traded and government securities.\nThe bond market has historically been a dealer-quoted OTC market, although electronic trading and liquid ETF products are gaining in prominence.

costs can also be measured through referencing market prices and volumes reported into the TRACE (Trade Reporting and Compliance Engine) system for U.S. corporate bonds.\nTo manage liquidity risk, managers can:\n\nUse more-liquid on-the-run securities for shorter-term strategies and less liquid securities for longer-term strategies.\nUse liquid fixed-income alternatives such as credit default swaps (CDS) or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\nUse asset swaps to hedge exposure on illiquid bonds over the time it takes to transact. For example, a manager wishing to sell a large illiquid holding over a long period of time could enter a pay-fixed asset swap to hedge the fixed-coupon income received on the corporate bond. As the trade in the underlying bond is slowly executed, the swap should be concurrently unwound.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Tail risk\n“Tail risk” refers to the risk of losses due to infrequent but high negative impact events.\nValue at risk (VaR) is a measure of minimum expected loss occurring in a given time frame with a specified probability.\n\nParametric method. This assumes returns are normal and uses the parameters (mean and standard deviation) to calculate the loss at a given percentile of the distribution. The advantage of the parametric VaR method is that it is simple to apply. The disadvantage if that it does not perform well for portfolios with non-normal distribution, such as those containing options.\nHistorical simulation. This applies historical movements in key risk factors (movements in rates, spreads, etc.) to the existing portfolio in order to generate a return distribution. The advantage of this historical VaR is that it uses actual market data and can handle portfolios with non-normal returns. The disadvantage is that it is heavily dependent on the historical sample used, and this history may not be a guide to the future.\nMonte Carlo analysis. This generates return distribution through random simulations from a user-defined model. The advantage is that the user-defined model has the flexibility to incorporate non-normal distributions. The disadvantage is that there is high model risk (i.e., the VaR is highly dependent on model assumptions being sound).\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nVaR as a tail risk measure has the following drawbacks:\n\nTail events tend to be more frequent and more severe than VaR forecasts.\nIt fails to capture changes in correlation and liquidity during times of market stress. (contagion effect)\nIt fails to quantify the expected loss during a tail event.\n\nSeveral extensions of VaR exist that are aimed to addressing these drawbakcs:\n\nConditional value at risk (CVaR) is the expected loss given the portfolio is experiencing a loss in the tail. It is a measure of the average loss in the tail and addresses the third drawback listed previously.\nIncremental VaR (IVaR) or partial VaR) measures the change in VaR from adding or removing a position in a portfolio.\nRelative VaR measures the VaR of a portfolio’s returns relative to a benchmark.\n\nRisk analysis should extend beyond quantitative estimates of loss to consider the consequences of experiencing large losses in times of stress. For example, managers using leverage should model the impact of margin calls, managers of DB plan assets should consider the ability of plan sponsors to meet extra contributions, and treasurers of banks should assess their ability to meet regulatory reserves in times of stress.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

formula, note this is simply adjusting “1,” which represents 100% of par, for the up-front premium to create an inverse relationship between CDS prices and spreads. For higher-quality issuers, the CDS spread will be lower than the fixed coupon and the CDS price will be above par.

    "text": "Global credit strategies\n\nAttempts to diversify through investing in different sectors (e.g., sovereign issuers vs. corporate issuers) in an emerging market that is heavily reliant upon a dominant industry or commodity export may yield little success, as all securities are likely to perform in a similar way.\nSignificant sector differences may exist, even between developed markets.\nDifferences in accounting standards across markets may affect the liquidity, profitability, and solvency ratios used in credit analysis.\nDifferences in the magnitude and timing of the credit cycle across countries often present opportunities in yields, exchange rates, and credit spread curves.\n\n\\[\nR_{DC} = (1 + R_{FC})(1 + R_{FX}) -

It assumes people are rational, risk-averse, and selfish utility maximizers who act in their own self-interests without regard to social values. Such individuals will act as rational economic men (REM), which will led to efficient markets where prices accurately reflect all available, relevant information. Traditional finance is concerned with normative analysis and determining the rational solution to a problem. It uses prescriptive analysis to look for practical tools and methods to find those rational solutions.\nBehavioral finance is descriptive, which focuses on describing how individuals actually behave and make decisions. Behavioral finance recognizes that the way information is presented can affect decision-making, leading to both emotional and cognitive biases.\nThis revealed many of the systematic biases in human decision-making.\nthe way of information presented = framing\nBehavioral finance looks at normal behavior of individual market participants (Behavioral Finance Micro) and the effect of such behavior on markets (Behavioral Finance Macro). A better understanding of the biases of clients (and of the professionals who work with those clients) should allow for the construction of portfolios that better approximate the efficiency of traditional finance and with which clients are better able to adhere to with during adverse conditions."

    "text": "Cognitive errors: belief perseverance\n\nConservation bias\nConservation bias occurs when market participants rationally form an initial view but then fail to change that view as new information becomes available. Individuals may react slowly to new data or ignore information that is complex to process.\nConsequences and implications of conservatism may include market participants who:\n\nare unwilling or slow to update a view or forecast for new information, and therefore hold an investment too long.\nportfolio를 바꾸지 않음\nhold an investment too long to avoid the mental effort or stress of updating a view, when the new information is complex to understand.\n\nThe more difficult the thought process or complex the information is, the greater the effort there is correctly updating prior beliefs. This effort is known as cognitive cost. The greater the cognitive cost associated with a new source of information, the less likely it is to be correctly processed.\n\n\nConfirmation bias\nConfirmation bias occurs when market participants look for new information or distort new information to support an existing view. Psychologists refer to the discomfort individuals feel when presented with information that is contrary to their beliefs as cognitive dissonance. (인지부조화) Subconsciously, human nature rejects this information to avoid the discomfort.\ncognitive dissonance를 벗어나고자 하는 systematic effort\nConsequences and implications of confirmation may include market participants who:\n\nconsider positive but ignore negative information and therefore hold 1. investments too long.\nset up the decision process or data screens incorrectly to find what they want to see.\nUnderdiversify as they become overly convinced their ideas are correct, 2. resulting in concentrated positions. (underdiversify)\n3. Over concentrated in the stock of their employer (treasury stock) believing they have an information advantage in to that security.\n\nexcessive turnover\n\n\n\n\nRepresentativeness bias\nRepresentativeness bias occurs when the similarity of objects or events confuses individuals’ assessments regarding the probability of an outcome. Representativeness is based on a belief the past will persist and new information is classified based on past experience or classification.\n대표성의 오류 = classification error (분류의 문제)\n→ systematic error → classify하고 나중에 가서 error를 인지하게 됨\n소수의 법칙 - sample이 population을 대변하게 되는 현상, but sample is too small.\ntwo forms of representativeness include:\n\nbase rate neglect, where the base rate (probability) of the initial classification is not adequately considered.\n처음부터 classification criteria가 잘못됨\nsample-size neglect makes the initial classification based on an overly small and potentially unrealistic sample of data.\n\nFor example, a fund manager may show strong performance over a three-year time horizon. This may lead investors to assume this manager has superior skill. However, over a short time horizon, results may have arisen from luck rather than skill.\nConsequences and implications of representativeness may include market participants who:\n\nattach too much importance to new pieces of information, or to a small sample. The impacts of such behavior can be excessive turnover based on short-term performance. The result can be excessive transaction fees and subsequent underperformance of the asset or fund that participants have switched to.\nMake decisions based on simple rules of thumb and classification without thorough and more difficult analysis, which incur a high cognitive cost.\n\nRepresentativeness detection starts with a better understanding of the laws of probability and statistical analysis. By thinking in terms of probabilities, it is more likely risk will be considered and sufficient diversification will occur.\nLong-term asset allocation should be implemented to create a diversified portfolio. A long-run perspective should be taken to avoid chasing short-term performance and excessive trading.\nThe following questions should avoid short-termism and ensure appropriate investments:\n\nHow does the performance compare to similar portfolios (rather than to the general market alone)?\nHave there been changes in the managers of the portfolio?\nWhat is the general reputation of the manager?\nHas the portfolio or manager changed style or investment approach due to changing conditions?\n\n\n\nIllusion of control bias\nIllusion of control bias exists when market participants think they can control or affects outcomes when they cannot. It is often associated with emotional biases: illusion of knowledge (belief you know things you do not know), self-attribution (Belief you personally caused something to happened), and overconfidence biases (an unwarranted belief you are correct).\nself-attribution, 자기기인오류\n\n내로남불, 잘 된 건 내 탓, 안 된 건 남 탓\n\nconsequences and implications of illusion of control may include market participants who:\n\ntrade more than is appropriate as they mistakenly believe they can control the outcome of a trade or are overconfident in their analysis.\nexcessive turnover\nfail to adequately diversify because they analyze a narrow range of investments and fail to consider other investments and asset types.\n\n\n\nHindsight bias\nHindsight bias is a selective memory of past events, actions, or what was knowable in the past, resulting in an individual’s tendency to see things as more predictable than they really are. Participants tend to remember their correct views and forget the errors. (systematic) They also overestimate what could have been known. Hindsight bias is sometimes referred to as the I-know-it-all-along phenomenon.\n후견지명, “내 그럴 줄 알았어”\nConsequences and implications of hindsight may include market participants who:\n\noverestimate the rate at which they correctly predicted events which could reinforce an emotional overconfidence bias.\nBecome overly critical of the performance of others."

Changes are made but in relation to the initial view and therefore the changes are inadequate. This makes it closely related to conservatism and a reluctance to change as new information is received.\n수정 기준점이 문제가 됨\nconservatism은 adjustment하지 않음, 그러나 anchoring bias는 adjustment를 하는데 잘못하는 것\nConsequences and implications of anchoring and adjustment may include market participants who stay anchoring to an initial estimate and do not adequately adjust for new information.\n\n\nMental accounting bias\nMental accounting bias arises when money is treated differently depending on how it is categorized. For example a client might mentally treat wages differently from a bonus when determining saving and investment goals. Each mental account has its own budget and reference point and is viewed in isolation, rather than in the context of the individual’s entire budget. This behavior violates the traditional finances assumption that money is fungible and therefore interchangeable between accounts, and that investments are considered in the context of the entire portfolio.\nConsequences and implications of mental accounting may include market participants:\n\nStructuring portfolios in layers to meet different priority goals. This may help clients overcome other biases. But it ignores correlation between layers of the portfolio and results can be suboptimal from a traditional perspective.\nlayering = pyramiding = goal-based investing (GBI)각 layer마다 correlation 무시, goal 중심유일하게 positive effect가 있는 bias\nFailing to lower portfolio risk by adding assets with very low correlation.\nSegregating return into arbitrary categories of income, realized gains and losses, or unrealized gains and losses. People tend to illogically distinguish between returns from income and capital gains. The tendency is to conserve capital gains but spend income. The result tends to be an overemphasis on income generating assets, resulting in a lower total return.\n나이가 들수록 income-generating portfolio 선호income의 source를 구분하는 현상을 보임\n\nMental accounting could be detected by examining what the portfolio could have achieved if the entire client assets were examined as one portfolio considering the effects of correlation among all parts of the portfolio. An excessive focus on source of return could be detected by analyzing the maximum total return consistent with the investor’s risk objective and constraints.\ntraditional finance - total return accounting\nmental accounting - income source based\n\n\nFraming bias\nFraming bias occurs when decisions are affected by the way in which the question or data is “framed.”\nConsequences and implications of framing bias may include market participants who:\n\nfail to properly assess risk and end up overly risk-averse or risk-seeking\nChoose suboptimal risk for their portfolio or assets based on the way presentation is made.\nBecome overly concerned with short term price movement and trade too often.\n\n\n\nAvailability bias\nAvailability bias starts with putting undue emphasis on the information that is readily available. Availability bias occurs when individuals judge the probability of an event occurring by the ease with which examples and instances come easily to mind. Ease of recall suggests that if something is easily recalled in memory, it must occur with a higher probability.\nAvailability bias can be further broken down into the following overlapping causes:\n\nRetrievability - If an idea or answer can be thought of quicker than others can, it is often chosen as correct, even if it is not.\nCategorization\nNarrow range of experience\nResonance (공명) - 내가 좋아하니 남도 좋아할 것\n\nConsequences and implications of availability may include market participants who:\n\nChoose a manager or investment based on advertising or recalling they have heard the name.\nLimit investment choices to what they are familiar with and fail to consider alternative investments, resulting in:\nunder-diversification inappropriate asset allocation\nOverreact to recent market conditions while ignoring data on historic performance\nPlace too much emphasis on events that receive a large amount of media attention or advertising.\n\nProblems created by availability include overreacting and trading too much based on recent and easily available news or relying on available information or opinions that are of low quality and relevance. → Herding behavior, 뇌동매매"

Kahneman and Tversky found that humans look at decisions as gains or losses relative to a reference rate. Anything below the reference rate is seen a loss, and above the reference rate a gain. → framing bias와 combined\n\nreference point의 중요성 → framing bias에 노출\ndiminishing sensitivity\nloss aversion (asymmetric response)\n\nBe sure to understand the difference between risk aversion and loss aversion. As a result, the individual is more likely to take risk in the hope of avoiding losses.\nConsequences and implications of loss-aversion may include:\n\nTo avoid having the pain of loss, an investment holder will tend to hold onto losers too long but may sell winners too quickly. This tendency is called the disposition effect.\nTrading too much by selling for small gains which raises transaction costs and lowers returns.\nIncurring too much risk by continuing to hold assets that have deteriorated in quality and lost value.\nIf an initial decline in value occurs, then taking excessive risk in the hope of recovering.\nTreating money that is made on a trade differently than other funds and taking excess risk with such money. (house money effect)\n도박으로 딴 돈은 쉽게 쓴다.mental accounting bias\n\nMyopic loss aversion (MLA) combines loss aversion, mental accounting, and time horizon-based framing. Investors Benartzi and Thaler use MLA to explain the equity premium puzzle.\n\nequity premium puzzle - 주식의 risk premium이 이론 값보다 더 높은 현상\nMLA - 단기손실회피 (myopic: 근시안적인)\n\nMLA argues that investors are loss averse and evaluate their portfolios too frequently. In the short term, losses are experienced more frequently than when examining performance over a longer time horizon. This short-term focus results in over reaction to short-term losses. The over-focus on short-term losses means that investors require high return potential on equities to justify investing in equity, and explains the equity premium.\n\n\nOverconfidence bias\nOverconfidence bias occurs when market participants overestimate their own intuitive ability or reasoning. It can show up as illusion of knowledge where they think they do a better job of predicting than they actually do. Combined with self-attribution bias, individuals will take personal credit when things go right (self-enhancing) but blame others or circumstances for failure (self-protecting). While it is both cognitive and emotional, it is more emotional in nature because it is difficult for most individuals to correct and is rooted in the desire to feel good.\nOverconfidence arising from an illusion of knowledge is based a general feeling that the individual will be right. Prediction overconfidence leads individuals to underestimate uncertainty and standard deviation of their predictions while certainly overconfidence occurs when they overstate the probability they will be right. Consequences and implications of overconfidence may include:\n\nUnderestimate risk and overestimate return\nUnder-diversification\nExcessive turnover and transaction costs resulting in lower return\n\n\n\nSelf-control bias\nSelf-control bias occurs when individuals lack self-discipline and favor immediate gratification over long-term goals. The tendency for individuals to favor small payoffs now compared to larger payoffs in the future is known as hyperbolic discounting. (쌍곡할인)\n\nillusion of control bias - control 할 수 있다고 착각\nlong-term saving과 short-term consumption을 스스로 control 할 수 있다고 착각\n\nConsequences and implications of self-control may include:\n\nInsufficient savings accumulation to fund retirement needs, resulting from favoring current spending over saving.\nTaking excessive risk in the portfolio to try and compensate for insufficient savings accommodation.\nAn overemphasis on income producing assets to meet shorter-term income needs.\n\n\n\nStatus quo bias\nStatus quo bias occurs when comfort with the existing situation leads to an unwillingness to make changes. Status quo bias is caused by the interaction of loss aversion bias, endowment bias, and regret aversion bias.\n\n결과적인 bias, 원인 bias에 의한 현상\nDo nothing, 현상유지오류\n\nConsequences and implications of status quo may include:\n\nholding portfolio with inappropriate risk\nNot considering other, potentially better investment options\n\nStatus quo is very hard to overcome so education regarding reasonable risk/return combinations and the danger of overconcentration in an (employer’s) stock is essential.

The illusion of control bias can lead analysts to feel they have all available data and have reduced or eliminated all risk in the forecasting model; hence, the link to overconfidence.\n\n모르는데 안다고 착각\n\nComplex financial models can increase overconfidence and the illusion of control. Analysts should avoid reliance on a particular historic data set (representativeness) to avoid models that optimize the data set but perform poorly out of sample.

(소수의 법칙)\nAn analyst exhibits the availability bias when he gives undue weight to more recent, readily recalled data.\nTo subconsciously protect their overconfidence, analysts utilize eco defense mechanisms.

Therefore, a change in the forward price indicates that the future spot rate(s) did not conform to the forward curve. When spot rates turn out to be lower (higher) than implied by the forward curve, the forward price will increase (decrease). A trader expecting lower future spot rates (then implied by the current forward rates) would purchase the forward contract to profit from its appreciation.\nFor a bond investor, the return on a bond over a one-year horizon is always equal to the one-year risk-free rate if the future spot rates evolve as predicted by today’s forward curve. If the spot curve one year from today is not the same as that predicted by today’s forward curve, the return over the one-year period will differ, with the return depending on the bond’s maturity.\nAn active portfolio manager will try to outperform the overall bond market by predicting how the future spot rates will differ from those predicted by the current forward curve.\nIf an investor believes that future spot rates will be lower than corresponding forward rates, then she will purchase bonds (at a presumably attractive price) because the market appears to be discounting future cash flows at “too high” of a discount rate.\n\n\n\nDiagram Description automatically generated"

Under this strategy, an investor will purchase bonds with maturities longer than his investment horizon. In an upward-sloping yield curve, shorter maturity bonds have lower yields than longer maturity bonds. As the bond approaches maturity, it is valued using successively lower yields and, therefore, at successively higher prices.\nIf the yield curve remains unchanged over the investment horizon, riding the yield curve strategy will produce higher returns than a simple maturity matching strategy, increasing the total return of a bond portfolio.

In other words, long-term interest rates equal the mean of future expected short-term rates. This implies that an investor should earn the same return by investing in a five-year bond or by investing in a three-year bond and then a two-year bond after the three-year bond matures. Similarly, an investor with a three-year investment horizon would be indifferent between investing in a three-year bond or in a five-year bond that will be sold two years prior to maturity. The underlying principle behind the pure expectations theory is risk neutrality.\nThe implications for the shape of the yield curve under the pure expectations theory are:\n- if the yield curve is upward sloping, short-term rates are expected to rise.\n- if the curve is downward sloping, short-term rates are expected to fall.\n- A flat yield curve implies that the market expects short-term rates to remain constant.\n\nLocal expectations theory\nThe local expectations theory preserves the risk-neutrality assumption only for short-term holding periods."

    "section": "Path dependency",
    "text": "Path dependency\nUnlike call risk, prepayment risk is affected not only by the level of interest rate at a particular point in time, but also by the path rates took to get there.\nAn important assumption of the binomial valuation process is that the value of the cash flows at a given point in time is independent of the path that interest rates followed up to that point. In other words, cash flows are not path dependent; cash flows at any node do not depend on the path rates took to get to that node. Because of path dependency of cash flows of mortgage-backed securities, the binomial tree backward induction process cannot be used to value such securities. We instead use the Monte Carlo simulation method to value mortgage-backed securities.\nA monte Carlo forward-rate simulation involves randomly generating a large number of interest rate paths, using a model that incorporates a volatility assumption and assumed probability distribution. A key feature of the Monte Carlo method is that the underlying cash flows can be path dependent.\nAs with pathwise valuation, the value of the bond is the average of values from the various paths. The simulated paths should be calibrated so benchmark interest rate paths value benchmark securities at their market price (i.e. arbitrage-free valuation). The calibration process entails adding (subtracting) a constant to all rates when the value obtained from the simulated paths is too high (too low) relative to market prices. This calibration process results in a drift adjusted model.\nA Monte Carlo simulation may impose upper and lower bounds on interest rates as part of the model generating the simulated paths. These bounds are based on the notion of mean reversion; rates tend to rise when they are too low and fall when they are too high.\n\n\n\nDiagram Description automatically generated"

The probability of default is indicated by the region in the left tail below the default barrier of X.\nAdvantages of structural models\n- Structural models provide an economic rationale for default and explain why default occurs.\n- Structural models utilize option pricing models to value risky debt.\nDisadvantages of structural models\n- Because structural models assume a simple balance sheet structure, complex balance sheets cannot be modeled. Additionally, when companies have off-balance sheet debt, the default barrier under structural models (X) would be inaccurate and hence the estimate outputs of the model will be inaccurate.\n- One of the key assumptions of the structural model is that the assets of the company are traded in the market. This restrictive assumption makes the structural model impractical.\n\n\n\nChart Description automatically generated\n\n\n\n\n\nA picture containing text, blackboard Description automatically generated\n\n\n\n\n\nA picture containing text, blackboard Description automatically generated"

    "text": "Reduced form models\nReduced form (RF) models do not rely on the structure of a company’s balance sheet and therefore do not assume that the assets of the company trade. Unlike the structural model, reduce form models do not explain why default occurs. Instead, they statistically model when default occurs. Default under the RF model is a randomly occurring exogenous variable.\nA key input into the RF model is the default intensity, which is the probability of default over the next (small) time period. Default intensity can be estimated using regression models.\nAdvantages of reduced form models\n- RF models do not assume that the assets of a company trade\n- Default intensity is allowed to vary as company fundamentals changes, as well as when the state of the economy changes.\nDisadvantages of reduced form models\n- RF models do not explain why default occurs.\n- Under RF models, default is treated as a random event, but in reality, default is rarely a surprise."

    "text": "Determinants of term structure of credit spreads\n\\1. Credit quality – lower-rated sectors tend to have steeper spread curves, reflecting greater uncertainty as well as greater sensitivity to the business cycle.\n\\2. Financial conditions – spreads narrow during economic expansions and widen during cyclical downturns. During boom times, benchmark yields tend to be higher while credit spreads tend to be narrower.\n\\3. Market demand and supply – recall that a credit spread includes a premium for lack of liquidity. Hence, less liquid maturities would show higher spreads (even if the expectations for that time period are stable). Due to low liquidity in most corporate issues, the credit curves are most heavily influenced by more heavily traded bonds.\n\\4. Equity market volatility – increases in equity volatility therefore tend to widen spreads and influence the shape of the credit spread curve."

Homogeneity of a pool refers to the similarity of the assets within the collateral pool. Granularity refers to the transparency of assets within the pool. A highly granular pool would have hundreds of clearly defined loans, allowing for use of summary statistics as opposed to investigating each borrower.\nShort-term granular and homogeneous structured finance vehicles are evaluated using a statistical-based approach. Medium-term granular and homogeneous obligations are evaluated using a portfolio-based approach because the portfolio composition varies over time. (segmentation해서 analysis) discrete and non-granular portfolios have to be evaluated at the individual loan level.\n\n\nServicer quality\nServicer quality is important to evaluate the ability of the servicer to manage the origination and servicing of the collateral pool.\n\n\nStructure\nStructure determines the tranching or other management of credit and other risks in a collateral pool.\nInternal / external credit enhancement\nA special structure is the case of covered bond. – loan을 true sale하지 않고, 담보로 structuring, 해당 loan들은 balance sheet에서 segregated\nIssued by a financial institution, covered bonds are senior, secured bonds backed by a collateral pool as well as by the issuer."

Say you were trying to predict the Price of square plots of land from the Length of one side. Fitting a linear model directly to Length gives poor results: the relationship is not linear.\nWhatever relationships your model can’t learn, you can provide yourself through transformations. As you develop your feature set, think about what information your model could use to achieve its best performance.\n\n\n\n\nA great first step is to construct a ranking with a feature utility metric, a function measuring associations between a feature and the target. Then you can choose a smaller set of the most useful features to develop initially and have more confidence that your time will be well spent.\nThe metric we’ll use is called “mutual information”. Mutual information is a lot like correlation in that it measures a relationship between two quantities. The advantage of mutual information is that it can detect any kind of relationship, while correlation only detects linear relationships.\nMutual information is a great general-purpose metric and especially useful at the start of feature development when you might not know what model you’d like to use yet. It is:\n\neasy to use and interpret,\ncomputationally efficient,\ntheoretically well-founded,\nresistant to overfitting, and,\nable to detect any kind of relationship\n\n\n\nMutual information describes relationships in terms of uncertainty. The mutual information (MI) between two quantities is a measure of the extent to which knowledge of one quantity reduces uncertainty about the other.\nTechnical note: What we’re calling uncertainty is measured using a quantity from information theory known as “entropy”. The entropy of a variable means roughly: “how many yes-or-no questions you would need to describe an occurance of that variable, on average.” The more questions you have to ask, the more uncertain you must be about the variable. Mutual information is how many questions you expect the feature to answer about the target.\n\n\n\nThe least possible mutual information between quantities is 0.0. When MI is zero, the quantities are independent: neither can tell you anything about the other. Conversely, in theory there’s no upper bound to what MI can be. In practice though values above 2.0 or so are uncommon. (Mutual information is a logarithmic quantity, so it increases very slowly.)\nHere are some things to remember when applying mutual information:\n\nMI can help you to understand the relative potential of a feature as a predictor of the target, considered by itself.\nIt’s possible for a feature to be very informative when interacting with other features, but not so informative all alone. MI can’t detect interactions between features. It is a univariate metric.\nThe actual usefulness of a feature depends on the model you use it with. A feature is only useful to the extent that its relationship with the target is one your model can learn. Just because a feature has a high MI score doesn’t mean your model will be able to do anything with that information. You may need to transform the feature first to expose the association.\n\nScikit-learn has two mutual information metrics in its feature_selection module: one for real-valued targets (mutual_info_regression) and one for categorical targets (mutual_info_classif).\n\n\n\nimage-20211002165106048\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002165210148\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTips on Discovering New Features\n\nUnderstand the features. Refer to your dataset’s data documentation, if available.\nResearch the problem domain to acquire domain knowledge. If your problem is predicting house prices, do some research on real-estate for instance. Wikipedia can be a good starting point, but books and journal articles will often have the best information.\nStudy previous work. Solution write-ups from past Kaggle competitions are a great resource.\nUse data visualization. Visualization can reveal pathologies in the distribution of a feature or complicated relationships that could be simplified. Be sure to visualize your dataset as you work through the feature engineering process.\n\n\n\nRelationships among numerical features are often expressed through mathematical formulas, which you’ll frequently come across as part of your domain research. In Pandas, you can apply arithmetic operations to columns just as if they were ordinary numbers.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002172808194\n\n\nData visualization can suggest transformations, often a “reshaping” of a feature through powers or logarithms.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002172830886\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures describing the presence or absence of something often come in sets, the set of risk factors for a disease, say. You can aggregate such features by creating a count.\nYou could also use a dataframe’s built-in methods to create boolean values. In the Concrete dataset are the amounts of components in a concrete formulation. Many formulations lack one or more components (that is, the component has a value of 0). This will count how many components are in a formulation with the dataframe’s built-in greater-than gt method:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002173033385\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002173043206\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally we have Group transforms, which aggregate information across multiple rows grouped by some category. If you had discovered a category interaction, a group transform over that categry could be something good to investigate.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002173131527\n\n\nIf you’re using training and validation splits, to preserve their independence, it’s best to create a grouped feature using only the training set and then join it to the validation set. We can use the validation set’s merge method after creating a unique set of values with drop_duplicates on the training set:\n\n\n\nimage-20211002173241055\n\n\nTips on Creating Features It’s good to keep in mind your model’s own strengths and weaknesses when creating features. Here are some guidelines:\n\nLinear models learn sums and differences naturally, but can’t learn anything more complex.\nRatios seem to be difficult for most models to learn. Ratio combinations often lead to some easy performance gains.\nLinear models and neural nets generally do better with normalized features. Neural nets especially need features scaled to values not too far from 0. Tree-based models (like random forests and XGBoost) can sometimes benefit from normalization, but usually much less so.\nTree models can learn to approximate almost any combination of features, but when a combination is especially important they can still benefit from having it explicitly created, especially when data is limited.\nCounts are especially helpful for tree models, since these models don’t have a natural way of aggregating information across many features at once.\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsupervised algorithms don’t make use of a target; instead, their purpose is to learn some property of the data, to represent the structure of the features in a certain way. In the context of feature engineering for prediction, you could think of an unsupervised algorithm as a “feature discovery” technique.\nClustering simply means the assigning of data points to groups based upon how similar the points are to each other.\nAdding a feature of cluster labels can help machine learning models untangle complicated relationships of space or proximity.\n\n\nApplied to a single real-valued feature, clustering acts like a traditional “binning” or “discretization” transform. On multiple features, it’s like “multi-dimensional binning” (sometimes called vector quantization).\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nIt’s important to remember that this Cluster feature is categorical.Here, it’s shown with a label encoding (that is, as a sequence of integers) as a typical clustering algorithm would produce; depending on your model, a one-hot encoding may be more appropriate.\nThe motivating idea for adding cluster labels is that the clusters will break up complicated relationships across features into simpler chunks. Our model can then just learn the simpler chunks one-by-one instead having to learn the complicated whole all at once. It’s a “divide and conquer” strategy.\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are a great many clustering algorithms. They differ primarily in how they measure “similarity” or “proximity” and in what kinds of features they work with. The algorithm we’ll use, k-means, is intuitive and easy to apply in a feature engineering context. Depending on your application another algorithm might be more appropriate.\nK-means clustering measures similarity using ordinary straight-line distance (Euclidean distance, in other words). It creates clusters by placing a number of points, called centroids, inside the feature-space. Each point in the dataset is assigned to the cluster of whichever centroid it’s closest to. The “k” in “k-means” is how many centroids (that is, clusters) it creates. You define the k yourself.\nYou could imagine each centroid capturing points through a sequence of radiating circles. When sets of circles from competing centroids overlap they form a line. The result is what’s called a Voronoi tessallation. The tessallation shows you to what clusters future data will be assigned; the tessallation is essentially what k-means learns from its training data.\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nWe’ll focus on three parameters from scikit-learn’s implementation: n_clusters, max_iter, and n_init.\nIt’s a simple two-step process. The algorithm starts by randomly initializing some predefined number (n_clusters) of centroids. It then iterates over these two operations:\n\nassign points to the nearest cluster centroid\nmove each centroid to minimize the distance to its points\n\nIt iterates over these two steps until the centroids aren’t moving anymore, or until some maximum number of iterations has passed (max_iter).\nIt often happens that the initial random position of the centroids ends in a poor clustering. For this reason the algorithm repeats a number of times (n_init) and returns the clustering that has the least total distance between each point and its centroid, the optimal clustering.\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nYou may need to increase the max_iter for a large number of clusters or n_init for a complex dataset. Ordinarily though the only parameter you’ll need to choose yourself is n_clusters (k, that is). The best partitioning for a set of features depends on the model you’re using and what you’re trying to predict, so it’s best to tune it like any hyperparameter (through cross-validation, say).\nSince k-means clustering is sensitive to scale, it can be a good idea rescale or normalize data with extreme values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002180704464\n\n\nX = df.copy()\ny = X.pop(\"SalePrice\")\n\n\n# YOUR CODE HERE: Define a list of the features to be used for the clustering\nfeatures = ['LotArea', 'TotalBsmtSF', 'FirstFlrSF', 'SecondFlrSF', 'GrLivArea']\n\n\n# Standardize\nX_scaled = X.loc[:, features]\nX_scaled = (X_scaled - X_scaled.mean(axis=0)) / X_scaled.std(axis=0)\n\n\n# YOUR CODE HERE: Fit the KMeans model to X_scaled and create the cluster labels\nkmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=10, n_init=10, random_state=0)\nX[\"Cluster\"] = kmeans.fit_predict(X_scaled)\n\n\n# Check your answer\nq_2.check()\n\n\n\n\nJust like clustering is a partitioning of the dataset based on proximity, you could think of PCA as a partitioning of the variation in the data. PCA is a great tool to help you discover important relationships in the data and can also be used to create more informative features.\n(Technical note: PCA is typically applied to standardized data. With standardized data “variation” means “correlation”. With unstandardized data “variation” means “covariance”. All data in this course will be standardized before applying PCA.)\n\n\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nNotice that instead of describing abalones by their 'Height' and 'Diameter', we could just as well describe them by their 'Size' and 'Shape'. This, in fact, is the whole idea of PCA: instead of describing the data with the original features, we describe it with its axes of variation. The axes of variation become the new features.\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nThese new features are called the principal components of the data. The weights themselves are called loadings. There will be as many principal components as there are features in the original dataset: if we had used ten features instead of two, we would have ended up with ten components.\nPCA also tells us the amount of variation in each component. We can see from the figures that there is more variation in the data along the Size component than along the Shape component. PCA makes this precise through each component’s percent of explained variance.\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nThe Size component captures the majority of the variation between Height and Diameter. It’s important to remember, however, that the amount of variance in a component doesn’t necessarily correspond to how good it is as a predictor: it depends on what you’re trying to predict.\n\n\n\nThe first way is to use it as a descriptive technique. Since the components tell you about the variation, you could compute the MI scores for the components and see what kind of variation is most predictive of your target. That could give you ideas for kinds of features to create – a product of 'Height' and 'Diameter' if 'Size' is important, say, or a ratio of 'Height' and 'Diameter' if Shape is important. You could even try clustering on one or more of the high-scoring components.\nThe second way is to use the components themselves as features. Because the components expose the variational structure of the data directly, they can often be more informative than the original features. Here are some use-cases:\n\nDimensionality reduction: When your features are highly redundant (multicollinear, specifically), PCA will partition out the redundancy into one or more near-zero variance components, which you can then drop since they will contain little or no information.\nAnomaly detection: Unusual variation, not apparent from the original features, will often show up in the low-variance components. These components could be highly informative in an anomaly or outlier detection task.\nNoise reduction: A collection of sensor readings will often share some common background noise. PCA can sometimes collect the (informative) signal into a smaller number of features while leaving the noise alone, thus boosting the signal-to-noise ratio.\nDecorrelation: Some ML algorithms struggle with highly-correlated features. PCA transforms correlated features into uncorrelated components, which could be easier for your algorithm to work with.\n\nPCA basically gives you direct access to the correlational structure of your data.\nPCA Best Practices There are a few things to keep in mind when applying PCA:\n\nPCA only works with numeric features, like continuous quantities or counts.\nPCA is sensitive to scale. It’s good practice to standardize your data before applying PCA, unless you know you have good reason not to.\nConsider removing or constraining outliers, since they can an have an undue influence on the results.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002182102193\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002182134006\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002182150973\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002182202310\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntarget encoding, is instead meant for categorical features. It’s a method of encoding categories as numbers, like one-hot or label encoding, with the difference that it also uses the target to create the encoding. This makes it what we call a supervised feature engineering technique.\nA target encoding is any kind of encoding that replaces a feature’s categories with some number derived from the target.\nThis kind of target encoding is sometimes called a mean encoding. Applied to a binary target, it’s also called bin counting. (Other names you might come across include: likelihood encoding, impact encoding, and leave-one-out encoding.)\n\n\nAn encoding like this presents a couple of problems, however. First are unknown categories. Target encodings create a special risk of overfitting, which means they need to be trained on an independent “encoding” split. When you join the encoding to future splits, Pandas will fill in missing values for any categories not present in the encoding split. These missing values you would have to impute somehow.\nSecond are rare categories. When a category only occurs a few times in the dataset, any statistics calculated on its group are unlikely to be very accurate.\nA solution to these problems is to add smoothing. The idea is to blend the in-category average with the overall average. Rare categories get less weight on their category average, while missing categories just get the overall average.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002183225844\n\n\nWhen choosing a value for m, consider how noisy you expect the categories to be. Does the price of a vehicle vary a great deal within each make? Would you need a lot of data to get good estimates? If so, it could be better to choose a larger value for m; if the average price for each make were relatively stable, a smaller value could be okay.\nUse Cases for Target Encoding Target encoding is great for:\n\nHigh-cardinality features: A feature with a large number of categories can be troublesome to encode: a one-hot encoding would generate too many features and alternatives, like a label encoding, might not be appropriate for that feature. A target encoding derives numbers for the categories using the feature’s most important property: its relationship with the target.\nDomain-motivated features: From prior experience, you might suspect that a categorical feature should be important even if it scored poorly with a feature metric. A target encoding can help reveal a feature’s true informativeness."

How various real options give managers flexibility with capital budgeting projects. Even if you are unsure how to handle the calculation of NPV involving real options, remember that the existence of options will always increase NPV. Finally, familiarize yourself with alternative concepts of calculating income, including economic income, economic profit, residual income, and claims analysis, and pay attention to the proper discount rate under each method.\n\n\n\n\nThe capital budgeting process is the process of identifying and evaluating capital projects; that is, projects where the cash flow to the firm will be received over a period longer than a year. Any corporate decisions with an impact on future earnings can be examined using the framework. Decisions about whether to buy a new machine, expand business in another geographic area, move the corporate headquarters to Cleveland, or replace a delivery truck, to name a few, can be examined using a capital budgeting analysis.\n\n\n\n\nReplacement projects to maintain the business\nReplacement projects for cost reduction\nExpansion projects\nNew product or market\nMandatory projects\nOther projects\n\n\n\n\n\nDecisions are based on cash flows, not accounting income.\nThe relevant cash flows to consider as part of the capital budgeting process are incremental cash flows.\nSunk costs are costs that cannot be avoided, even if the project is not undertaken. (과거 cost는 고려하지 않음) An example of a sunk cost is a consulting fee paid to a marketing research firm to estimate demand for a new product prior to a decision on the project.\nExternalities - cannibalization\n\npre-emptive cannibalization - 시장 선점 목적, 수익률은 떨어지지만 NPV 극대화\n\nCash flows are based on opportunity costs.\nThe timing of cash flows is important.\nCapital budgeting decisions account for the time value of money, which means that cash flows received earlier are worth more than cash flows to be received later.\nCash flows are analyzed on an after-tax basis.\nFinancing costs are reflected in the project’s required rate of return.\nThe required rate of return is a function of its risks.\n\n\n\n\n\ncase by case로 적용되서 보통 table을 제시하는데, 정 안주면 Double-declining method로 depreciation 계싼하면 됨.\nIn the United States, modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) for tax purposes.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017195221848\n\n\nThe depreciable basis is equal to the purchase price plus any shipping or handling and installation costs. The basis is not adjusted for salvage value regardless of whether the accelerated or straight-line method is used.\nSalvage value 고려 않고 0까지 deprecation in tax.\n\n\n\n\nInitial investment outlay is the up-front costs associated with the project.

This means that accelerated depreciation methods will create higher after-tax cash flows for the project earlier in the project’s life as compared to the straight-line method, resulting in a higher net present value (NPV) for the project.\nInterest is not included in operating cash flows for capital budgeting purposes because it is incorporated into the project’s cost of capital.\n\nTerminal value after-tax non-operating cash flows (TNOCF)\n\n\\[\n\\\\TNOCF = Sal_{T} + NWCInv - T(Sal_{T} - B_{T})\n\\\\Sal_{T} = \\text{pre-tax cash procedds from sale of fixed capital}\n\\\\B_{T} = \\text{book value of the fixed capital sold}\n\\]\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200110833\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200117903\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200356823\n\n\n\n\n\n증분고려\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200148649\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200154973\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200202853\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200209278\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200422080\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInflation is a complication.\n\nAnalyzing nominal or real cash flows. - Nominal cash flows should be discounted at a nominal discount rate, while real cash flows should be discounted at a real discount rate.\n\nrate adjusted for inflation -> real rate\n\nChanges in inflation affect project profitability. - If inflation is higher than expected, future project cash flows are worth less, and the value of the project will be lower than expected. The opposite is also true, however. If inflation turns out to be lower than originally expected, future cash flows from the project will be worth more, effectively increasing the project’s value.\nInflation reduces the tax savings from deprecation.\nInflation decreases the value of payments to bondholders.\nInflation may affect revenues and costs differently.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen two projects are mutually exclusive, the firm may choose one project or the other, but not both. It mutually exclusive projects have different lives, and the projects are expected to be replaced indefinitely as they wear out, an adjustment needs to be made in the decision-making process.\n\nLeast common multiple of lives approach - 최소공배수법\nEquivalent annual annuity (EAA) approach\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200951691\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017200957730\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017201011848\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017201023378\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017201029806\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017202636161\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017202642823\n\n\n\n\n\nCapital rationing is the allocation of a fixed amount of capital among the set of available projects that will maximize shareholder wealth. Greatest total NPV.\nNote that capital rationing is not the optimal decision from the firm’s perspective. Therefore, capital rationing violates market efficiency because society’s resources are not allocated to their best use (i.e., to generate the highest return).\nHard capital rationing occurs when the funds allocated to managers under the capital budget cannot be increased. Soft capital rationing occurs when managers are allowed to increase their allocated capital budget if they can justify to senior management that the additional funds will create shareholder value.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017202000892\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017202006586\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensitivity analysis involves changing an input (independent) variable to see how sensitive the dependent variable is to the input variable. For example, by varying sales, we could determine how sensitive a project’s NPV is to changes in sales, assuming that all other factors are held constant. The key to sensitivity analysis is to only change one variable at a time.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017202315045\n\n\nScenario analysis is a risk analysis technique that considers both the sensitivity of some key output variable to changes in a key input variable and the likely probability distribution of these variables. The key difference between scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis is that scenario analysis allows for changes in multiple input variables all at once.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017202309221\n\n\nSimulation analysis (or Monte Carlo simulation) results in a probability distribution of project NPV outcomes, rather than a limited number of outcomes as with sensitivity or scenario analysis.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017202358612\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\R_{project} = R_{F} + \\beta_{project}[E(R_{MKT}) - R_{F}]\n\\]\nUsing a project’s beta to determine discount rates is important when the risk of a project is different from the risk of the overall company. Simply using the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) will overstate the required return for a conservative (low beta) project and will understate the required return for an aggressive (high beta) project.\n\n\n\nReal options allow managers to make future decisions that change the value of capital budgeting decisions made today.\n\nTiming options\nAbandonment options are similar to put options.

Accounting income will differ from economic income because:\n\nAccounting depreciation is based on the original cost (not market value) of the investment.\nFinancing costs are considered as a separate line item and subtracted out to arrive at net income. In the basic capital budgeting model, financing costs are reflected in the WACC.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017203855837\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017203901374\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017203907124\n\n\nThe accounting income differs from the economic income for two reasons.\n\nAccounting depreciation is based on the original cost of the investment, while economic depreciation (beginning - ending value) is based on the market value of the asset. The economic depreciation for the project is much larger than the accounting depreciation, resulting in an economic income amount that is much smaller than accounting income.\nInterest expense is deducted from the accounting income figure. Interest expense is ignored when computing economic income because it is reflected in the WACC.\n\n\n\n\nEconomic profit is a measure of profit in excess of the dollar cost of capital invested in a project. \\[\n\\\\EP = NOPAT - \\$WACC\n\\\\NOPAT = \\text{net operating profit after tax} = EBIT(1 - t)\n\\\\\\$WACC = \\text{dollar cost of capital} = WACC * capital\n\\\\Capital = \\text{dollar amount of investment}\n\\]  \\[\n\\\\NPV = MVA = \\sum_{t = 1}^{\\infty}{\\frac{EP_{t}}{(1 + WACC)^{t}}}\n\\\\MVA = \\text{market value added}\n\\] Residual income focuses on returns on equity and is determined by subtracting an equity charge from the accounting net income. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{residual income} = \\operatorname{net income} - \\operatorname{equity charge}\n\\\\RI_{t} = NI_{t} - r_{e}B_{t - 1}\n\\\\NPV = \\sum_{t = 1}^{\\infty}{\\frac{RI_{t}}{(1 + r_{e})^{t}}}\n\\] The residual income approach focuses only on returns on equityholders; therefore, the appropriate discount rate is the required return on equity.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205118120\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205123097\n\n\nThe claims valuation approach (청구권 방식, FCFF, FCFE 활용) divides operating cash flows based on the claims of debt and equityholders that provide capital to the company. These debt and equity cash flows are valued separately and then added together to determine the value of the company.\nThe claims valuation method calculate the value of the company not the project. This is different from the economic profit and residual income approaches, which calculate both project and company value.\nThe claims valuation approach is based on the balance sheet concept that assets equal liabilities plus equity.\n\nThe cash flows to debtholders consist of interest and principal payments and are discounted at the cost of debt.\nThe cash flows to equityholders are dividends and share repurchases and are discounted at the cost of equity.\n\nThe sum of the present value of each stream of cash flows will equal the value of the company.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205412535\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205421790\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205532597\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205538033\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205544205\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205550042\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205556196\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205601907\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205607235\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215634145\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215641187\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215647237\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215654934\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017205619151\n\n\n\n\nProgression is from MM 1958 (no taxes, no costs of financial distress) to MM 1963 (with taxes, no costs of financial distress) to the static trade-off theory (with taxes and with costs of financial distress).\nIn moving to MM 1963, we are able to see how introducing taxes affects the cost of capital and firm value. Remember, the goal of managers in a capital structure decision is to minimize the weighted average cost of capital (and thereby maximize the value of the company).\n\n\n\nIn 1958, Professors Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (MM) published their seminal work on capital structure theory. Under a very restrictive set of assumptions, MM proved that the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure. MM’s results suggest that in a perfect world, it does not matter how a firm finances its operations.\nAssumptions\n\nCapital markets are perfectly competitive - There are no transaction costs, taxes, or bankruptcy costs.\nInvestors have homogeneous expectations\nRiskless borrowing and lending - Investors can borrow/lend at the risk-free rate.\nNo agency costs - No conflict of interest between managers and shareholders.\nInvestment decisions are unaffected by financing decisions - Operating income is independent of how assets are financed.\n\nIn the MM no-tax world, the value of a company is not affected by its capital structure.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017213434459\n\n\nConsider why the pie analogy holds true. The operating earnings (EBIT) of a firm are available to all providers of capital. In a company with no debt, all of the operating earnings are available to equityholders, and the value of the company is the discounted present value of these earnings. \\[\n\\\\V_{L} = V_{U}\n\\\\V_{L} = \\text{value of levered firm}\n\\\\V_{U} = \\text{value of unlevered firm}\n\\] Given our assumptions, an investor can have homemade leverage.\n\n\n\nMM’s second proposition with no taxes states that the cost of equity increases linearly as a company increases its proportion of debt financing. Therefore, the benefits of using a larger proposition of debt as a cheaper source of financing are offset by the rise in the cost of equity, resulting in no change in the firm’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC). \\[\n\\\\r_{e} = r_{0} + \\frac{D}{E}(r_{0} - r_{d})\n\\] As leverage increases, the cost of equity increases, but WACC and the cost of debt are unchanged.\n\n\n\nimage-20211017213748033\n\n\nMM’s second proposition supports their first proposition. Because the benefits of lower cost debt are offset by the increased cost of equity, the relative amount of debt versus equity in the firm’s capital structure does not affect the overall value of the firm.\n\n\n\nTax shield provided by debt. Under the tax code of most countries, interest payments are a pretax expense and are therefore tax deductible, while dividends are paid on an after-tax basis. The differential tax treatment encourages firms to use debt financing because debt provides a tax shield that adds to the value of the company. \\[\n\\\\V_{L} = V_{U} + t * d\n\\] If we maintain MM’s other assumptions, the value of the company increases with increasing levels of debt, and the optimal capital structure is 100% debt.\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\r_{E} = r_{0} + \\frac{D}{E}(r_{0} - r_{D})(1 - T_{C})\n\\]\n\n\n\nimage-20211017214135286\n\n\n\n\n\nCosts of financial distress - static-trade-off theory (1973)\n\nCosts of financial distress and bankruptcy can be direct or indirect. Direct costs of financial distress include the cash expenses associated with the bankruptcy, such as legal fees and administrative fees. Indirect costs include foregone investment opportunities and the costs that result from losing the trust of customers, creditors, suppliers, and employees.\nProbability of financial distress is related to the firm’s use of operating and financial leverage.\n\nAgency costs of equity refer to the costs associated with the conflicts of interest between managers and owners. Managers who do not have a stake in the company do not bear the costs associated with excessive compensation or taking on too much (or too little) risk.\nNet agency cost of equity\n\nMonitoring costs\nBonding costs\nResidual losses\n\nAccording to agency theory, the use of debt forces managers to be disciplined with regard to how they spend cash because they have less free cash to use for their own benefit.\nCost of asymmetric information refer to costs resulting from the fact that managers typically have more information about a company’s prospects and future performance that owners or creditors. Firms with complex products or little transparency in financial statements tend to have higher costs of asymmetric information, which results in higher required returns on debt and equity capital.\nBecause shareholders and creditors are aware that the asymmetric information problems exist, these investors will look for management behavior that ‘signals’ what knowledge management may have. Specifically, management’s choice of debt or equity financing may provide a signal regarding management’s opinion of the firm’s future prospects.\n\nTaking on the commitment to make fixed interest payments through debt financing sends a signal that management has confidence in the firm’s ability to make these payment in the future.\nIssuing equity is typically viewed as a negative signal that managers believe a firm’s stock is overvalued.\n\nPecking order theory, based on asymmetric information, is related to the signals management sends to investors through its financing choices. Financing choices under pecking order theory follow a hierarchy based on visibility to investors with internally generated capital being the most preferred, debt being the next best choice, and external equity being the least preferred financing option.\n\nInternally generated equity (RE)\nDebt\nExternal equity (newly issued shares)\n\nTherefore, the pecking order theory predicts that the capital structure is a by-product of the individual financing decisions.\n\n\n\nThe static trade-off theory seeks to balance the costs of financial distress with the tax shield benefits from using debt. Under the static trade-off theory, there is an optimal capital structure that has an optimal proportion of debt.\nIf we remove the assumption that there are no costs of financial distress, there comes a point where the additional value added from the debt tax shield is exceeded by the value-reducing costs of financial distress from the additional borrowing. This point represents the optimal capital structure for a firm where the WACC is minimized and the value of the firm is maximized. \\[\n\\\\V_{L} = V_{U} + t * d - PV(\\operatorname{costs of financial distress})\n\\] \n\n\n\nimage-20211017215253064\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215339695\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215347996\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215406596\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215430554\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215443414\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215521917\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215545652\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211017215552466\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget capital structure\nFor managers trying to maximize the value of the firm, the target capital structure will be the same as the optimal capital structure.\n\nManagement may choose to exploit opportunities in a specific-financing source. For example, a temporary rise in the firm’s stock price may create a good opportunity to issue additional equity.\nMarket value fluctuations will occur.

Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (MM) maintain that dividend policy is irrelevant, as it has no effect on the price of a firm’s stock or its cost of capital. MM’s argument of dividend irrelevance is based on their concept of homemade dividends. Assume, for example, that you are a shareholder and you don’t like the firm’s dividend policy. If the firm’s cash dividend is too big, you can just take the excess cash received and use it to buy more of the firm’s stock. If the cash dividend you received was too small, you can sell a little bit of your stock in the firm to get the cash flow you want. In either case, the combination of the value of your investment in the firm and your cash in hand will be the same.\nBird-in-hand (dividend preference theory) argument for dividend policy.\nMyron Gordon and John Lintner, however, argue that \\(r_{s}\\) decreases as the dividend payout increases. Why? Because investors are less certain of receiving future capital gains from the reinvested earnings than they are of receiving current (and therefore certain) dividend payments.\nTax aversion. In many countries, dividends have historically been taxed at higher rates than capital gains. In the 1970s, US tax rates on dividend income were as high as 70%, while the taxes on capital gains were 35%.\nIn the real world, tax laws often prevent companies form accumulating excess earnings, making dividend payments necessary. Also note that in 2003, tax laws in the United States changed so that dividends and long-term capital gins are both taxed at the same 15% rate.\nConclusions from the three theories. The results of empirical tests are unclear as to which of these theories best explains the empirical observations of dividend policy.\n\n\n\nInformation asymmetry refers to differences in information available to a company’s board and management (insiders) as compared to the investors (outsiders).\nThe information conveyed by dividend initiation is ambiguous. On one hand, a dividend initiation could mean that a company is optimistic about the future and is sharing its wealth with stockholders-a positive signal. On the other hand, initiating a dividend could mean that a company has a lack of profitable reinvestment opportunities-a negative signal.\nAn unexpected dividend increase can signal to investors that a company’s future business prospects are strong and that managers will share the success with shareholders. Studies have found that companies with a long history of dividend increase, such as GE and Exxon Mobil, are dominant in their industries and have high returns on assets and low debt ratios.\nUnexpected dividend decreases or omissions are typically negative signals that the business is in trouble and that management does not believe that the current dividend payment can be maintained.\nmarket에 시그널을 줄 수 있다.\n\n\n\n\n\nClientele effect. This refers to the varying dividend preferences of different groups of investors, such as individuals, institutions, and corporations.\n\nTax considerations - High-tax-bracket investors (like some individuals) tend to prefer low dividend payouts, while low-tax-bracket investors (like corporations and pension funds) may prefer high dividend payouts.\n\nWhen the stock goes ex-dividend: \\[\n\\\\\\Delta{P} = \\frac{D(1 - T_{D})}{1 - T_{CG}}\n\\]\n\nRequirements of institutional investors. For legal or strategic reasons, some institutional investors will invest only in companies that pay a dividend or have a dividend yield above some target threshold.\n\n\n\n\nBetween shareholders and managers: Agency costs reflect the inefficiencies due to divergence of interests between managers and stockholders. One aspect of agency issue is that managers may have an incentive to overinvest (“empire building”). This may lead to investment in some negative NPV projects, which reduces stockholders wealth. One way to reduce agency cost is to increase the payout of free cash flow as dividends. Generally, it makes sense for growing firms to retain a larger proportion of their earnings.\nBetween shareholders and bondholders: When there is risky debt outstanding, shareholders can pay themselves a large dividend, leaving the bondholders with a lower asset base as collateral.\n\n\n\nimage-20211018004125250\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment opportunities - If a firm faces many profitable investment opportunities and has to react quickly to capitalize on the opportunities, the dividend payout may be low.\nExpected volatility of future earnings - Hence, when earnings are volatile, firms are more cautious in changing dividend payout.\nFinancial flexibility - Firms with excess cash and a desire to maintain financial flexibility may resort to stock repurchases instead of dividends as a way to pay out excess cash. Since stock repurchase plans are not considered sticky (i.e., there is no implicit expectation by the market of an ongoing repurchase program), they don’t entail reduction in financial flexibility going forward.\nTax considerations - Investors are concerned about after-tax returns.\nFloatation costs - When a company issues new shares of common stock, a floatation cost of 3% to 7% is taken from the amount of capital raised to pay for investment bankers and other costs associated with issuing the new stock. Since retained earnings have no such fee, the cost of new equity capital is always higher than the cost of retained earnings. Generally, the higher the floatation costs, the lower the dividend payout, given the need for equity capital in positive NPV projects.\nContractual and legal restrictions - Companies may be restricted from paying dividends either by legal requirements or by implicit restrictions caused by cash needs of the business.\n\nImpairment of capital rule\nDebt covenants\n\n\n\n\n\nDouble-taxation system\n\n\n\nimage-20211017223108553\n\n\nSplit-rate corporate tax system\nThe calculation of the effective tax rate under a split rate system is similar to the computation of the effective tax rate under double taxation except that the corporate tax rate applicable would be the corporate tax rate for distributed income\n\n\n\nimage-20211018000243493\n\n\nUnder an imputation tax system, taxes are paid at the corporate level but are attributed to the shareholder, so that all taxes are effectively paid at the shareholder rate.\n\n\n\nimage-20211018000319720\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018000329959\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018000500042\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018000658312\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018000704109\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018000711086\n\n\nAdvantages of the residual dividend model:\n\nThe model allows management to pursue profitable investment opportunities without being constrained by dividend considerations.\n\nDisadvantages of the residual dividend model:\n\nIf a firm follows the residual dividend policy, its dividend payments may be unstable. Investment opportunities and earnings often vary from year to year.\n\n\n\n\n\nFour common methods are used for share buybacks, though due to varying rules, some markets may not allow all methods. Outside the United States and Canada, method 1 is used almost exclusively.\n\nOpen market transactions are the most flexible approach, allowing a company to buy back its shares in the open market at the favorable terms.\nFixed price tender offer is an approach where the firm buys a predetermined number of shares at a fixed price, typically at a premium over the current market price. It allows a company to buy back its shares rather quickly. If more than the desired number of shares are tendered in response to the offer, the company will typically buy back a prorated number of shares from each shareholders responding to the offer.\nDutch auction is a tender offer in which the company specifies not a single fixed price but rather a range of prices. Dutch auctions identify the minimum clearing price for the desired number of shares that need to be repurchased. Each participating shareholder indicates the price and the number of shares tendered. Bids are accepted based on lowest price first until the desired quantity is filled.\nRepurchase by direct negotiation entails purchasing shares from a major shareholder, often at a premium over market price. This method is often used in a greenmail scenario (where a hostile bidder is offered a premium to go away) to the detriment of the remaining shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003032756\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003107909\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003113202\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential tax advantages - When the tax rate on capital gains is lower than the tax rate on dividend income, share repurchases have a tax advantage over cash dividends.\nShare price support/signaling - Companies may purchase their own stock, thereby signaling to the market that the company views its own stock as a good investment.\nAdded flexibility - A company could declare a regular cash dividend and periodically repurchase shares as a supplement to the dividend. Unlike dividends, share repurchases are not a long-term commitment. Since paying a cash dividend and repurchasing shares are economically equivalent.\nOffsetting dilution from employee stock options - Repurchases offset EPS dilution that results from the exercise of employee stock options.\nIncreasing financial leverage\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003404416\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003409746\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003414478\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003422065\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003451036\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018003517189\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA lower proportion of US companies pay dividends compared to their European counterparties.\nGlobally, in developed markets, the proportion of companies paying cash dividends has trended downwards over the long term.\nThe percentage of companies making stock repurchases has been trending upwards in the United States since the 1980s and in the United Kingdom and continental Europe since the 1990s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDividend payout ratio = dividends / net income\ndividend coverage ratio = net income / dividends\n\n\n\nimage-20211018004044901\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConcentrated ownership, where a single shareholder or a group of shareholders have control over the corporation. These controlling shareholders can be a family, other companies, or a sovereign entity. Dispersed ownership refers to the situation where the shareholders are numerous and non has control.\nPercentage ownership is not always a reliable indicator of concentration of control: certain shareholders may have a greater degree of control than their ownership percentage would suggest. A minority shareholder could have control of a corporation through a vertical ownership arrangement (where the group has a controlling interest in holding companies, which in turn have controlling interests in operating companies) or a horizontal ownership arrangement (where companies with common suppliers or customers cross-hold each other’s shares).\nAnother disconnect between control and percentage ownership comes in the form of dual-class shares, wherein one class of shareholders has fewer voting rights, while the other class has superior voting rights.\n\n\n\nDispersed ownership and dispersed voting power describes a situation where shareholders (called weak shareholders) do not hold power over managers (called strong managers). In this situation, principal-agent conflict is likely: shareholders want shareholder value maximized, while managers may use the firm’s resources to their own advantages. This problem can be mitigated by the presence of controlling shareholders.\nConcentrated ownership and concentrated voting power refers to a situation where so-called ‘strong’ shareholders hold power over minority shareholders and ‘weak’ managers. This arrangement allows controlling shareholders to control the board of directors and effectively control and monitor management. The downside of this situation is that a principal-principal problem may arise: controlling owners can take advantage of firm resources to the detriment of minority owners.\nDispersed ownership and concentrated voting power indicates that the majority of the shares of a company are not owned by strong controlling shareholders. Rather, the controlling shareholders gain control over other minority shareholders through pyramid structures or dual-class shares, despite the controlling shareholders having less-than-majority ownership (again, the principal-principal problem). These controlling shareholders’ voting power also allows them to monitor management.\nConcentrated ownership and dispersed voting power occurs in the presence of voting caps, where the voting rights of large share positions are restricted. Sovereign countries sometimes enact voting caps to discourage foreign investors from taking a controlling position in a company belonging to an industry that is considered important.\n\n\n\n\nBanks - When a bank lends money to a firm or holds an equity stake, the bank can often exert some control over that corporation. (This is especially common in Asia and Europe.) The bank does not take advantage of its role as lender at the expense of other shareholders.\nFamilies - In Latin America and some other places, family ownership is common. One advantage of family control is that principal-agent issues may be reduced. On the other hand, family ownership can make it difficult to recruit quality outsiders for management and often leads to lack of concern for minority shareholders, as well as minimal transparency and low accountability by management.\nState-owned enterprises (SOE) - A listed SOE is partly owned by the government and also trades on an exchange.\nInstitutional investors - In many countries, institutional investors can represent a large portion of equity ownership.\nGroup companies - Such as South Korea’s Samsung, can achieve an outsized amount of control through cross-holding of shares via vertical and horizontal ownership.\nPrivate equity firms - Introducing performance-based compensation for managers, or the addition of codes.\nForeign investors - Foreign investors typically demand greater accountability and transparency. This is particularly true in emerging market countries.\nManagers and board directors\n\n\n\n\n\nDirector independence - When a board member has no significant remuneration, ownership, or employment relationship with the firm, the board member is considered independent. Independent directors are important in countries with dispersed ownership where the principal-agent problem is greater and thus the board’s role of monitoring mangers is key.\nBoard structures - Under a two-tier structure, the management board is overseen by a supervisory board. This supervisory board performs functions such as determining management compensation, supervising external auditors, and reviewing the firm’s financial records. In some jurisdictions, representatives of stakeholders such as labor groups sit on the supervisory board.\nSpecial voting arrangements - Some countries attempt to provide an advantage to minority shareholders through special voting arrangements for board nomination and election.\nCorporate governance codes, laws, and listing requirements - Some countries have adopted national ‘comply or explain’ corporate governance codes that require firms to either best practices of corporate governance or explain why they have not.\nStewardship codes - Stewardship codes exist in some countries that seek to engage investors in corporate governance by exercising their legal rights.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen a company is not behaving according to stakeholders’ wishes, shareholder activism may occur: this is the term for techniques used by shareholders to force management to act in shareholders’ interests.\n\n\n\nStructure of board of directors - CEO duality occurs when the chairperson of the board is also the chief executive officer (CEO). CEO duality raises concerns that the chairperson’s oversight and monitoring responsibilities may not be effectively rendered.\nBoard independence - Ideally, a majority of board members should be independent; independent directors are more likely to prevent management from self-serving behavior.\nBoard committees - Such as compensation, nomination, and audit committees. When analyzing a corporation’s board, an analysts should consider whether the key committees related to financial reporting, management selection, and compensation are sufficiently independent.\nSkills and experience of board\nComposition of board - It has been observed in recent years that small, diverse boards of directors are generally more effective than large boards made up of members with similar backgrounds.\nOther board evaluation considerations. - A board of directors may be evaluated from a number of perspectives.\n\n\n\n\nClawback policies allow firms to reclaim past compensation if inappropriate conduct comes to light later. Say-on-pay rules can give stakeholders the opportunity to vote on executive compensation. The pay differential between the CEO and the firm’s average worker has come under scrutiny in recent years.\nearn-out - guarantee한 성과가 나오면 compensation을 더 주는 조항\n\n\n\nHolding various classes of shares. Some firms structure share offerings as a single class with equal voting rights. Alternatively, in a dual-class structure, the shares held by the firm’s founders or management have more voting power than hose sold to external investors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nESG data providers\nIndustry organizations\nProprietary methods - ESG data specific to a particular firm can be derived from sources such as 10-K regulatory filings, corporate sustainability reports, and annual reports.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFixed-income analysts usually will focus on ESG factors’ downside risk.\n\n\n\nEquity analysts consider both the upside and downside impact of ESG factors when valuing a firm’s stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor example, a company’s projected cash flow statements or income statement may be adjusted in terms of earnings, margins, revenues, costs, capital expenditures, or other items. Adjustments to the balance sheet often take the form of altering the value of assets of reflect impairment. The credit spread of a fixed-income instrument may be adjusted to reflect ESG concerns. Similarly, an adjustment to discount rate or cost of capital may be used to reflect ESG considerations in an equity analysis.\nGreen bonds are fixed-income instruments used to fund projects related to the environment.\n\n\n\n\nEnvironment factors - Concerned about wasting water, a soft-drink company has been able to lower its water usage in its manufacturing process over the past three years.\nSocial factors - A drug company has experienced a long string of product recalls, product quality controversies, and fines and warning letters from regulators. Negative valuation impacts for stock and bondholders are also appropriate, especially if the firm’s brand reputation is impaired.\nGovernance factors - Compared to its peers, a bank’s board is found to be lagging in a number of measure: the bank’s chairperson is not independent, the board’s overall independence and diversity is low, board members’ industry experience is low, and a number of board members have long tenures. In addition to these factors, the bank has a higher ratio of nonperforming loans than its peers. To reflect these additional risks, the analyst uses a higher risk premium to value the bank’s stock and also increases the credit spread used to value the bank’s debt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018040633506\n\n\nThe terms mergers and acquisitions, or M&A for short, generally refers to two businesses combining in some manner. But almost always someone is left unhappy (usually the managers that are removed, or workers that will be laid off).\nAn acquisition refers to one company buying only part of another company. If the acquirer absorbs the entire target company, the transaction is considered a merger. The initiator of the venture is referred to as the bitter, or acquirer, while the opposite side of the transaction is known as the target.\n\n\n\n\nThe acquiring company acquires all of the target’s assets and liabilities. As a result, the target company ceases to exist as a separate entity. Note that in a statutory merger, the target company is usually smaller than the purchaser, but this is not always the case.\n흡수합병, A + B = A\n\n\n\nAcquisition\n\n\n\n신설합병, A + B = C\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe two business operate in the same or similar industries, and may often be competitors.\n\n\n\nThe acquiring company seeks to move up or down the product supply chain.\nForward integration, where the acquirer is moving up the supply chain toward the ultimate consumer.\nBackward integration, the company is moving down the supply chain toward the raw material inputs.\n\n\n\n다각적 인수\nThe two companies operate in completely separate industries.\n\n\n\n\n\nSynergies - Cost synergies are exactly the strategy behind a pure horizontal merger. Revenue synergies are typically created by cross-selling products, increasing market share, or raising prices to take advantage of reduced competition.\nAchieving more rapid growth - External growth via M&A activity is usually a much faster way for managers to increase revenues than making investments internally (i.e., organic growth). Growth through M&A is especially common in mature industries where organic growth opportunities are limited. In addition, it is typically a less risky way to generate growth by acquiring resources through a merger with another company rather than developing them internally.\nIncreased market power - When a horizontal merger occurs in an industry with few competitors, the newly combined company will typically come away with increased market share and a greater ability to influence market prices. Vertical mergers may also increase market power by reducing dependence on outside suppliers.\nGaining access to unique capabilities - If a company is lacking a specific capability or resource, it can either try to develop it internally or seek to acquire something that already exists. M&A activity can be a cost effective way to acquire proven capabilities or resources.\nDiversification - Managers may cite the need to diversify the firm’s cash flows as grounds for a merger. This makes no sense for shareholders but may be rational for the managers. It is much easier and cheaper for the shareholders to diversify simply by investing in the shares of unrelated companies themselves rather than having one company go through the long, expensive process of acquiring and merging the two firms’ operations and corporate cultures. In fact, research has revealed that conglomerates trade at a discount relative to the sum of the value of individual businesses. In this case, the whole is less than the sum of the individual parts. This finding demonstrates that mergers are not likely to increase value purely for diversification reasons.\nBootstrapping EPS - Another motivation for mergers is the bootstrapping effect on earnings per share that sometimes results from a stock deal.\nPersonal benefits for managers - This means that there is a strong financial incentive for managers to maximize the size of the firm rather than shareholder value. In addition, being part of the executive team for a larger company implies greater power and prestige and is probably good for managerial egos.\nTax benefits\nUnlocking hidden value - When a company has struggled for an extended period of time, an acquirer may believe it can pay a lower price to buy the company and unlock hidden value by improving managements, adding resources, or improving the organizational structure.\nAchieving international business goals\n\nTaking advantages of market inefficiencies - Acquiring a manufacturing plant in a country where labor costs are less expensive is a prime example of gaining an advantage from an inefficient global marketplace.\nWorking around disadvantageous government policies - International M&A is a potential way to overcome barriers to free trade, such as tariffs or quotas.\nUse technology in new markets\nProduct differenciation\nProvide support to existing multinational clients\n\n\n\n\nBootstrapping is a way of packaging the combined earnings from two companies after a merger so that the merger generates an increase in the earnings per share of the acquirer, even when no real economic gains have been achieved.\nThe ‘Bootstrap effect’ occurs when a high P/E firm (generally a firm with high growth prospects) acquires a low P/E firm (generally a firm with low growth prospects) in a stock transaction. Post-merger, the earnings of the combined firm are simply the sum of the respective earnings prior to the merger. However, by purchasing the firm with a lower P/E, the acquiring firm is essentially exchanging higher-priced shares of lower-priced shares. As a result, the number of shares outstanding for the acquiring firm increases, but at a ratio that is less than 1-for-1. When we compute the EPS for the combined firm, the numerator (total earnings) is equal to the sum of the combined firms, but the denominator (total shares outstanding) is less than the sum of the combined firms. The result is higher reported EPS, even when the merger creates no additional synergistic value.\n\n\n\nimage-20211018023952955\n\n\nIn practice, the market tends to recognize the bootstrapping effect and post-merger P/E’s adjust accordingly. However, there have been periods in history, such as the technology bubble in the late 1990s, where bootstrapping helped high P/E companies show EPS growth, even in cases where the mergers created no value for shareholders.\n\n\n\nimage-20211018040648612\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018024118507\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstock purchase\n\nFinally, most stock purchases involves purchasing the entire company and not just a portion of it. This means that not only will the acquirer gain the target company’s assets, but it will also assume the target’s liabilities.\n\nasset purchase\n\nAsset purchase acquisitions usually focuses on specific parts of the company that are of particular interest to the acquirer, rather than the entire company, which means that the acquirer generally avoids assuming any of the target company’s liabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018024339238\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nexchange ratio\nThe total compensation ultimately paid by the acquirer in a stock offering is based on three factors: the exchange ratio, the number of shares outstanding of the target company, and the value of the acquirer’s stock on the day the deal is completed.\n\n\n\nWhen an acquirer is negotiating with a target over the method of payment, there are three main factors that should be considered:\n\nDistribution between risk and reward for the acquirer and target shareholders. - In a stock offering, since the target company’s shareholders receive new shares in the post-merger company, they share in the risk related to the ultimate value that is realized from the merger. In a cash offering, all of the risk related to the value of the post-merger company is borne by the acquirer. As a result, when the acquirer is highly confident in the synergies and value that will be created by the merger, it is more inclined to push for a cash offering.\nRelative valuations of companies involved. - If the acquirer’s shares are considered overvalued by the market, the acquirer is likely to want to use its overpriced shares as currency in the merger transaction. In fact, investors sometimes interpret a stock offering as a signal that the acquirer’s shares may be overvalued.\nChanges in capital structure. - If the acquirer borrows money to raise cash for a cash offering, the associated debt will increase the acquirer’s financial leverage and risk. Issuing new stock for a securities offering can dilute the ownership interest for the acquirer’s existing shareholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nFriendly merger offers usually begin with the acquirer directly approaching the target’s management. If both parties like the idea of a potential deal, they will negotiate the method of payment and the terms of the transaction. At this point, each party to the merger will conduct due diligence on the other party by examining financial statements and other records.\nHostile merger offers\n\ntender offer - the acquirer offers to buy the shares directly from the target shareholders, and each individual shareholder either accepts or rejects the offer.\nproxy battle - the acquirer seeks to control the target by having shareholders approve a new ‘acquirer approved’ board of directors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nflip-in pill - where the target company’s shareholders have the right to buy the target’s shares at a discount\nflip-over pill - where the target shareholders have the right to buy the acquirer’s shares at a discount.\nIn case of a friendly merger offer, most poison pill plans give the board of directors the right to redeem the pill prior to a triggering event.\n\n\n\nThese puts give bondholders the option to demand immediate repayment of their bonds if there is a hostile takeover. This additional cash burden may fend off a would-be acquirer.\n\n\n\nHistorically, Ohio and Pennsylvania have been considered to provide target companies with the most protection.\n\n\n\nEach group is elected for a 3-year term in a staggered system: in the first year the first group is elected, the following year the next group is elected, and in the final year the third group is elected.\n\n\n\nimage-20211018035647856\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA supermajority provision in the corporate charter requires shareholder support in excess of a simple majority. For example, a supermajority provision may required 66.7%, 75%, or 80% of votes in favor of a merger.\n\n\n\nA fair price amendment restricts a merger offer unless a fair price is offered to current shareholders.\n\n\n\nGolden parachutes are compensation agreements between the target and its senior management that give the managers lucrative cash payouts if they leave the target company after a merger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first step in avoiding a hostile takeover offer is to simply say no. If the potential acquirer goes directly to shareholders with a tender offer or a proxy fight, the target can make a public case to the shareholders concerning why the acquirer’s offer is not in the shareholder’s best interests.\n\n\n\nThe basic idea is to file a lawsuit against the acquirer that will require expensive and time-consuming legal efforts to right. The typical process is to attack the merger on anti-trust grounds or for some violation of securities law. The courts may disallow the merger or provide a temporary injunction delaying the merger, giving managers more time to load up their defense or seek a friendly offer from a while knight.\n\n\n\nEssentially, greenmail is a payoff to the potential acquirer to terminate the hostile takeover attempt. Greenmail is an agreement that allows the target to repurchase its shares from the acquiring company at a premium to the market price.\n\n\n\nThe target company can submit a tender offer for its own shares.\n\n\n\nIn a leveraged recapitalization, the target assumes a large amount of debt that is used to finance share repurchases. Like the share repurchase, the effect is to create a significant change in capital structure that makes the target less attractive while delivering value to shareholders.\n\n\n\nAfter a hostile takeover offer, a target may decide to sell a subsidiary or major asset to a neutral third party. If the hostile acquirer views this asset as essential to the deal (i.e., a crown jewel), then it may abandon the takeover attempt. The risk here is that courts may declare the strategy illegal if a significant asset sale is made after the hostile bid is announced.\n\n\n\nAfter a hostile takeover offer, the target can defend itself by making a counteroffer to acquire the acquirer. In practice, the Pac-Man defense is rarely used because it means a smaller company would have to acquire a larger company, and the target may also lose the use of other defense tactics as a result of its counteroffer.\n\n\n\nA white knight is a friendly third party that comes to the rescue of the target company. The target will usually seek out a third party with a good strategic fit with the target that can justify a higher price than the hostile acquirer. In many cases, the white knight defense can start a bidding war between the hostile acquirer and the third party, resulting in the target receiving a very good price when a deal is ultimately completed. This tendency for the winner to overpay in a competitive bidding situation is called the winner’s curse.\n대신 인수해줄 사람 찾기\n\n\n\nThe target seeks a friendly third party that bus a minority stake in the target without buying the entire company.\n의결권 지원\n\n\n\n\n\nHHI (Herfindahl-Hirschman Index) \\[\n\\\\HHI = \\sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(MS_{i} * 100)^{2}}\n\\] \n\n\n\nimage-20211018031159064\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComparable company analysis uses relative valuation metrics for similar firms to estimate market value and then adds a takeover premium to determine a fair price for the acquirer to pay for the target.\n\n\n\nimage-20211018031345117\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018031349930\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018031356358\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018031402055\n\n\n\n\nComparable transactions analysis uses details from recent takeover transactions of similar companies to estimate the target’s takeover value. The methodology behind the approach is very similar to the comparable company approach we just showed you, except that all of the comparables are firms that have recently been taken over. The biggest challenge is finding enough relevant takeover transactions for firms that are similar to the target being analyzed.\n\n\n\nimage-20211018031542012\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018031546578\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nIt is relatively easy to model nay changes in the target company’s cash flow resulting from operating synergies or changes in cost structure that may occur after the merger.\nThe estimate of company value is based on forecasts of fundamental conditions in the future rather than on current data.\nThe model is easy to customize.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe model is difficult to apply when free cash flows are negative.\nEstimates of cash flows and earnings are highly subject to error, especially when those estimates are for time periods far in the future.\nDiscount rate changes over time can have a large impact on the valuation esimtate.\nEstimation error is a major concern since the majority of the estimated value for the target is based on the terminal value, which is highly sensitive to estimates used for the constant growth rate and discount rate.\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages\n\nData for comparable companies is easy to access.\nAssumption that similar assets should have similar values is fundamentally sound.\nEstimates of value are derived directly from the market rather than assumptions and estimates about the future.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe approach implicitly assumes that the market’s valuation of the comparable companies is accurate.\nUsing comparable companies provides an estimate of a fair stock price, but not a fair takeover price. An appropriate takeover premium must be determined separately.\nIt is difficult to incorporate merger synergies or changing capital structures into the analysis.\nHistorical data used to estimate a takeover premium may not be timely, and therefore may not reflect current conditions in the M&A market.\n\n\n\n\nComparable transaction analysis uses details from completed M&A deals for companies similar to the target being analyzed to calculate an estimated value for the target.\nAdvantages\n\nSince the approach uses data from actual transactions, there is no need to estimate a separate takeover premium.\nEstimates of value are derived directly from recent prices for actual deals completed in the marketplace rather than from assumptions and estimates about the future.\nUse of prices established by recent transactions reduces the risk that the target’s shareholders could file a lawsuit against the target’s managers and board of directors for mispricing the deal.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nThe approach implicitly assumes that the M&A market valued past transactions accurately. If past transactions were over or underpriced, the mispricing will be carried over toe the estimated value for the target.\nThere may not be enough comparable transactions to develop a reliable data set for use in calculating the estimated target value. If the analyst isn’t able to find enough similar companies, she may try to use M&A deals from other industries that are not similar enough to the deal being considered.\nIt is difficult to incorporate merger synergies or changing capital structures into the analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018040726025\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018040733760\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018040742138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018033745234\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018033756444\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018033806574\n\n\n\n\n\nWith a cash offer, the target firm’s shareholders will profit by the amount paid over its current share price (i.e., takeover premium). However, this gain is capped at that amount.\nWith a stock offer, the gains will be determined in part by the value of the combined firm, because the target firm’s shareholders do not received cash and just walk away, but rather retain ownership in the new firm. Accordingly, for a stock deal we must adjust our formula for the price of the target: \\[\n\\\\P_{T} = N * P_{AT}\n\\] \n\n\n\nimage-20211018034021067\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018034027765\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means that the acquirer will want to pay the lowest possible price (the pre-merger value of the target, \\(V_{T}\\)), while the target wants to receive the highest possible price (the pre-merger value of the target plus the expected synergies, \\(V_{T} + S\\))\n\n\n\nIn a cash offer, the acquirer assumes the risk and receives the potential reward form the merger, while the gain for the target shareholders is limited to the takeover premium.\n\n\n\nIn a stock offer, some of the risks and potential rewards from the merger shift to the target firm.\nThe main factor that affects the method of payment decision is confidence in the estimate of merger synergies. The more confident both parties are synergies will be realized, the more acquirer will prefer to pay cash and the more the target will prefer to receive stock. Conversely, if estimates of synergies are uncertain, the acquirer may be willing to shift some of the risk (and potential reward) to the target by paying for the merger with stock, but the target may prefer the guaranteed gain that comes from a cash deal.\n\n\n\n\nShort-term performance studies that look at stock returns before and after merger announcement dates conclude that targets gain approximately 30%, while acquirers lose stock value of between 1% and 3%.\nWinner’s curse\nManagers also may overestimate the synergies and expected benefits of the merger. This tendency is called managerial hubris.\nSome mergers do enhance value for the acquirer. Acquirer are likely to earn positive returns on a deal characterized by:\n\nStrong buyer\nLow premium\nFew bidders\nFavorable market reaction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivestitures refer to a company selling, liquidating, or spinning off a division or subsidiary.\n\n\n\nEquity carve-outs create a new, independent company by giving an equity interest in a subsidiary to outside shareholders. Shares of the subsidiary are issued in a public offering of stock, and the subsidiary becomes a new legal entity whose management team and operations are separate from the parent company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211018040534546\n\n\nSpin-offs are like carve-outs in that they create a new independent company that is distinct from the parent company. The primary difference is the shares are not issued to the public, but are instead distributed proportionately to the parent company’s shareholders. This means that the shareholder based of the spin-off will be the same as that of the parent company, but the management team and operations are completely separate.\n인적분할\n\n\n\nSplit-offs allow shareholders to receive new shares of a division of the parent company in exchange for a portion of their shares in the parent company. The key here is that shareholders are giving up a portion of their ownership in the parent company to receive the new shares of stock in the division.\n물적분할\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDivision no longer fits into management’s long-term strategy\nLack of profitability\nIndividual parts are worth more than the whole\nInfusion of cash"

Gifts must be disclosed to the member’s employer in any case, either prior to acceptance if possible, or subsequently.\n\n\n\nDo not be pressured by sell-side firms to issue favorable research on current or prospective investment-banking clients. It is appropriate to have analysts work with investment bankers in “road shows” only when the conflicts are adequately and effectively managed and disclosed. Be sure there are effective “firewalls” between research/investment management and investment banking activities.\n\n\n\nAnalysts should not be pressured to issue favorable research by the companies they follow. Do not confine research to discussions with company management, but rather use a variety of sources, including suppliers, customers, and competitors.\n\n\n\nBuy-side clients may try to pressure sell-side analysts. Portfolio managers may have large positions in a particular security, and a rating downgrade may have an effect on the portfolio performance. As a portfolio manager, there is a responsibility to respect and foster intellectual honesty of sell-side research.\n\n\n\nMembers responsible for selecting outside managers should not accept gifts, entertainment, or travel that might be perceived as impairing their objectivity.\n\n\n\n성과기여도 발라내기\nPerformance analysts may experience pressure from investment managers who have produced poor results or acted outside their mandate. Members and candidates who analyze performance must not let such influences affect their analysis.\n\n\n\npay-to-play\nMembers and candidates must exercise independence and objectivity when they select investment managers. They should not accept gifts or other compensation that could be seen as influencing their hiring decisions, nor should they offer compensation when seeking to be hired as investment managers.\n\n\n\nopinion임\nMembers employed by credit rating firms should make sure that procedures prevent undue influence by the firm issuing the securities. Members who use credit ratings should be aware of this potential conflict of interest and consider whether independent analysis is warranted.\n\n\n\n\nCreate a restricted list and distribute only factual information about companies on the list.\nRestrict special cost arrangements\nLimit gifts\nRestrict employee investments in equity IPOs and private placements. Require pre-approval of IPO purchases.\nFirms should have formal written policies on independence and objectivity of research.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102031251757\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102031257712\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102031303564\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102031308977\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062145872\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must not knowingly make any misrepresentations relating to investment analysis, recommendations, actions, or other professional activities.\n\n\nTrust is a foundation in the investment profession. Do not make anFy misrepresentations or give false impressions. This includes oral, electronic, and social media communications. Misrepresentations include guaranteeing investment performance and plagiarism. Plagiarism encompasses using someone else’s work (reports, forecasts, models, ideas, charts, graphs, and spreadsheet models) without giving them credit. Knowingly omitting information that could affect an investment decision or performance evaluation is considered misrepresentation.\nModels and analysis developed by others at a member’s firm are the property of the firm and can be used without attribution. A report written by another analyst employed by the firm cannot be released as another analyst’s work.\n\n\n\nA written list of the firm’s available services and a description of the firm’s qualifications. Employee qualifications should be accurately presented as well. To avoid plagiarism, maintain records of all materials used to generate reports or other firm products and properly cite sources (quotes and summaries) in work products. Information from recognized financial and statistical reporting services need not be cited.\nMembers should encourage their firms to establish procedures for verifying marketing claims of third parties whose information the firm provides to clients.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102061157062\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102061205888\n\n\nPlagiarism is defined as copying or using in substantially the same form materials prepared by others without acknowledging the source of the material or identifying the author and publisher of such material. Members and candidates must not copy (or represent as their own) original ideas or material without permission and must acknowledge and identify the source of ideas or material that is not their own.\nMisrepresentation through plagiarism in investment management can take various form. The simplest and most flagrant example is to take a research report or study done by another firm or person, change the names, and release the material as one’s own original analysis. This action is a clear violation of Standard I(C). Other practices include 1) using excerpts from articles or reports prepared by other either verbatim or with only slight changes in wording without acknowledgement, 2) citing specific quotations as attributable to “leading analysts” and “investment experts” without naming the specific references, 3) presenting statistical estimates of forecasts prepared by others and identifying the sources but without including the qualifying statements or caveats that may have been used, 4) using charts and graphs without stating their sources, and 5) copying proprietary computerized spreadsheets or algorithms without seeking the cooperation or authorization of their creators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102031922926\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102031930706\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102031939706\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062229666\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must not engage in any professional conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, or deceit or commit any act that reflects adversely on their professional reputation, integrity, or competence.\n\n\nDo not abuse CFA Institute’s Professional Conduct Program by seeking enforcement of this Standard to settle personal, political, or other disputes that are not related to professional ethics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102032135978\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102032141526\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062250120\n\n\nMembers and Candidates who posses material nonpublic information that could affect the value of an investment must not act or cause others to act on the information.\n\n\nInformation is “material” if its disclosure would impact the price of a security or if reasonable investors would want the information before making an investment decision. Ambiguous information, as far as its likely effect on price, may not be considered material. Information is “nonpublic” until it has been made available to the marketplace. an analyst conference call is not public disclosure. Selectively disclosing information by corporations creates the potential for insider-trading violations.\nSome members and candidates may be involved in transactions during which they receive material nonpublic information provided by firms (e.g., investment banking transactions). Members and candidates may use the provided nonpublic information for its intended purpose, but must not use the information for any other purpose unless it becomes public information.\n\n\n\nThere is no violation when a perceptive analyst reaches an investment conclusion about a corporate action or event through an analysis of public information together with items of nonmaterial nonpublic information.\n\n\n\nnon-public 취급\nWhen gathering information from internet or social media sources, members and candidates need to be aware that not all of it is considered public information. Members and candidates should confirm that any material information they receive from these sources is also available from public sources, such as company press releases or regulatory filings.\n\n\n\nMembers and candidates may seek insight from individuals who have specialized expertise in an industry. However, they may not act or cause others to act on any material nonpublic information obtained from these experts until that information has been publicly disseminated.\n\n\n\nMake reasonable efforts to achieve public dissemination of the information.\n\nSubstantial control of relevant interdepartmental communications, through a clearance area such as the compliance or legal departement.\nMonitor and restrict proprietary trading while a firm is in possession of material nonpublic information. - risk-arbitrage trading is not allowed.\nProhibition of all proprietary trading while a firm is in possession of material nonpublic information may be inappropriate because it may send a signal to the market. In these cases, firms should take the contra side of only unsolicited customer trades. - market making is allowed\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102033151157\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102033157979\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must not engage in practices that distort prices or artificially inflate trading volume with the intent to mislead market participants.\nprice or volume + intent\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102033310016\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102033317042\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062332887\n\n\nMembers and Candidates have a duty of loyalty to their clients and must act with reasonable care and exercise prudent judgment. Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of their clients and place their clients’ interests before their employer’s or their own interests.\n\n\nClient interests always come first. Although this Standard does not impose a fiduciary duty on members or candidates where one did not already exist, it does require members and candidates to act in their clients’ best interest and recommend products that are suitable given their clients’ investment objectives and risk tolerances.\n\nmanage polls of client assets in accordance with the terms of the governing documents, such as trust documents or investment management agreements.\n\nIII(C) 고려, 문건대로 운영, beneficiary 고려 -> 그래도 원하면 IPS 변경\n\nMake investment decisions in the context of the total portfolio.\nVote proxies in an informed and responsible manner.

Fairly does not mean equally. In the normal course of business, there will be differences in the time emails, faxes, etc., are received by different clients. Different service levels are okay, but they must not negatively affect or disadvantage any clients. Disclose the different service levels to all clients and prospects, and make premium levels of service available to all who wish to pay for them.\n\n\n\nGive all clients a fair opportunity to act upon every recommendation. Client who are unaware of a change in a recommendation should be advised before the order is accepted.\n\n\n\nTreat clients fairly in light of their investment objectives and circumstances. Treat both individual and institutional clients in a fair and impartial manner. Members and candidates should not take advantage of their position in the industry to disadvantage clients.\n\n\n\n\nLimit the number of people who are aware that a change in recommendation will be made.\nShorten the time frame between decision and dissemination.\nPublish personnel guidelines for pre-dissemination-have in place guidelines prohibiting personnel who have prior knowledge of a recommendation from discussing it or taking action on the pending recommendation.\nSimultaneous dissemination of new or changed recommendations to all clients who have expressed an interest or for whom an investment is suitable.\nDevelop written trade allocation procedures-ensure fairness to clients, timely and efficient order execution, and accuracy of client positions.\nDisclose trade allocation procedures.\nDisclose available levels of service.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102035025605\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102035030062\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062504871\n\n\n\nWhen Members and Candidates are in an advisory relationship with a client, they must:\n\nMake a reasonable inquiry into a client’s or prospective clients’ investment experience, risk and return objectives, and financial constraints prior to making nay investment recommendation or taking investment action and must reassess and update this information regularly.\nDetermine that an investment is suitable to the client’s financial situation and consistent with the client’s written objectives, mandates, and constraints before making an investment recommendation or taking investment action.\nJudge the suitability of investments in the context of the client’s total portfolio.\n\nWhen Members and Candidates are responsible for managing a portfolio to a specific mandate, strategy, or style, they must make only investment recommendations or take only investment actions that are consistent with the stated objectives and constraints of the portfolio.\n\n\n\nIn advisory relationships, be sure to gather client information at the beginning of the relationship, in the form of an investment policy statement (IPS). Consider clients’ needs and circumstances and thus their risk tolerance. Consider whether or not the use of leverage is suitable for the client.\nIf a member is responsible for managing a fund to an index or other stated mandate, be sure investments are consistent with the stated mandates.\n\n\n\nMembers should put the needs and circumstances of each client and the client’s investment objectives into a written IPS for each client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102061918428\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102061812169\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102035627037\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102035632679\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102035637707\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen communicating investment performance information, Members or Candidates must make reasonable efforts to ensure that it is fair, accurate, and complete.\n\n\nMembers must avoid misstating performance or misleading clients/prospects about investment performance of themselves or their firms, should not misrepresent past performance or reasonably expected performance, and should not state or imply the ability to achieve a rate of return similar to that achieved in the past. For brief presentations, members must make detailed information available on requests and indicate that the presentation has offered limited information.\n\n\n\nEncourage firms to adhere to Global Investment Performance Standards.\n\nConsidering the sophistication of the audience to whom a performance presentation is addressed.\nPresenting performance of weighted composite of similar portfolios rather than a single account.\nIncluding terminated accounts as part of historical performance and clearly stating when they were terminated.\nIncluding all appropriate disclosures to fully explained results (e.g., model results included, gross or net of fees, etc.).\nMaintaining data and records used calculate the performance being presented.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102040200685\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102040206104\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102040210753\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062558495\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must keep information about current, former, and prospective clients confidential unless:\n\nThe information concerns illegal activities on the part of the client or prospective client,\nDisclosure is required by law, or\nThe client or prospective client permits disclosure of the information.\n\n\n\nIf illegal activities by a client are involved, members may have an obligation to report the activities to authorities. The confidentiality Standard extends to former clients as well.\nThe requirements of this Standard are not intended to prevent Members and Candidates from cooperating with a CFA Institute Professional Conduct Program (PCP) investigation.\n\n\n\nMembers should avoid disclosing information received from a client except to authorized co-workers who are also working for the client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102040547353\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102040551788\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102040557386\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062607886\n\n\nIn matters related to their employment, Members and Candidates must act for the benefit of their employer and not deprive their employer of the advantage of their skills and abilities, divulge confidential information, or otherwise cause harm to their employer.\n\n\nmembers must not engage in any activities which would injure the firm, deprive it of profit, or deprive it of the advantage of employees’ skills and abilities. Members should always place client interests above interests of their employer but consider the effects of their actions on firm integrity and sustainability.\n\n\n\nIndependent practice for compensation is allowed if a notification is provided to the employer fully describing all aspects of the services, including compensation, duration, and the nature of the activities and if the employer consents to all terms of the proposed independent practice before it begins.\n\n\n\nMembers must continue to act in their employer’s best interests until resignation is effective. Activities which may constitute a violation include:\n\nMisappropriation of trade secrets\nMisuse of confidential information\nSoliciting employer’s clients prior to leaving\nSelf-dealing\nMisappropriation of client lists\n\nEmployer records on any medium (e.g., home computer, PDA, cell phone) are the property of the firm.\nOnce an employee has left a firm, simple knowledge of names and existence of former clients is generally not confidential. There is also no prohibition on the use of experience or knowledge gained while with a former employer. If an agreement exists among employers that permits brokers to take certain client information when leaving a firm, a member or candidate may act within the terms of the agreement without violating the Standard.\n\n\n\nMembers and candidates must adhere to their employers’ policies concerning social media. When planning to leave an employer, members and candidates must ensure that their social media use complies with their employers’ policies for notifying clients about employer separations. A best practice is to use separate social media accounts for personal and professional communications.\n\n\n\nThere may be isolated cases where a duty to one’s employer may be violated in order to protect clients or the integrity of the market, and not for personal gain.\n\n\n\nIf Members and Candidates are independent contractors, they still have a duty to abide by the terms of the agreement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102052746583\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102052752483\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102052800860\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102052806321\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062655608\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must not accept gifts, benefits, compensation, or consideration that competes with or might reasonably be expected to create a conflict of interest with their employer’s interest unless they obtain written consent from all parties involved.\n\n\nCompensation includes direct and indirect compensation from a client and other benefits received from third parties.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102052953089\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102052959922\n\n\nIf a client gives us money for doing a good job (one time), we need to disclose it (though not necessarily in writing).\nIf we have an agreement with a client that we will receive money in the future for outperformance, we need to disclose that in writing.\nFor any side job that potentially competes with our employer, written permission is required.\nFor a side job (e.g., bartender) that’s unrelated to our primary job, no disclosure is required.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062725039\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must make reasonable efforts to ensure that anyone subject to their supervision or authority complies with applicable laws, rules, regulations, and the Code and Standards.\n\n\nDuty - Delegation 가능 / Responsibility - Delegation 불가\nMembers must make reasonable efforts to prevent employees from violating laws, rules, regulations, or the Code and Standards, as well as make reasonable efforts to detect violations.\n\n\n\nUnderstand that an adequate compliance system must meet industry standards, regulatory requirements, and the requirements of the Code and Standards.\nA member or candidate faced with no compliance procedures or with procedures he believes are inadequate must decline supervisory responsibility in writing until adequate procedures are adopted by the firm.\n\n\n\n\nDesignate a compliance officer with authority clearly defined.\n\nIf there a violation, respond promptly and conduct a thorough investigation while increasing supervision or placing limitations on the wrongdoer’s activities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102053544336\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102053550948\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062736908\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal and national economic conditions\nA firm’s financial results, operating history, and business cycle stage\nFees and historical results for a mutual fund\nLimitations of any quantitative models used\nA determination of whether peer group comparisons for valuation are appropriate\n\n\n\n\nMembers must be able to explain the basic nature of the quantitative research and how it is used to make investment decisions. Members should consider scenarios outside those typically used to assess downside risk and the time horizon of the data used for model evaluation to ensure that both positive and negative cycle results have been considered.\n\n\n\nThe Standard requires greater diligence of members and candidates who create quantitative techniques than of those who use techniques developed by others. Members and candidates must understand the technical details of the products they offer to clients. A member or candidate who has created a quantitative strategy must test it thoroughly, including extreme scenarios with inputs that fall outside the range of historical data, before offering it to clients.\n\n\n\nTo review any external advisers\n\n\n\nEven if a member does not agree with the independent and objective view of the group, he does not necessarily have to decline to be identified with the report, as long as there is a reasonable and adequate basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102054206726\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102054211906\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102054217064\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must:\n\nDisclose to clients and prospective clients the basic format and general principles of the investment processes they use to analyze investments, select securities, and construct portfolios and must promptly disclose any changes that might materially affect those processes.\nDisclose to clients and prospective clients significant limitations and risks associated with the investment process.\nUse reasonable judgment in identifying which factors are important to their investment analyses, recommendations, or actions and include those factors in communications with clients and prospective clients. - factors up to you, but disclose\nDistinguish between fact and opinion in the presentation of investment analysis and recommendations.\n\n\n\nIn preparing recommendations for structured securities, allocation strategies, or any other nontraditional investment, members should communicate those risk factors specific to such investments. In all cases, members should communicate the potential gains and losses on the investment clearly in terms of total return. Members are required to communicate significant changes in the risk characteristics of an investment process, including any risks and limitations that have been newly identified.\nWhen using projections from quantitative models and analysis, members may violate the Standard by not explaining the limitations of the model and the assumptions it uses, which provides a context for judging the uncertainty regarding the estimated investment result.\nMembers and candidates must inform clients about limitations inherent to an investment. Liquidity refers to the ability to exit an investment readily without experiencing a significant extra cost for doing so. Capacity refers to an investment vehicle’s ability to absorb additional investment without reducing the returns it is able to achieve.\n\n\n\nSelection of relevant factors in a report can be a judgment call, so be sure to maintain records indicating the nature of the research, and be able to supply additional information if it is requested by the client or other users of the report.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102054948130\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102054954359\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102055000821\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102055005700\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062012526\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102055401329\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must make full and fair disclosure of all matters that could reasonably be expected to impair their independence and objectivity or interfere with respective duties to their clients, prospective clients, and employers. Members and candidates must ensure that such disclosures are prominent, are delivered in plain language, and communicate the relevant information effectively.\n\n\nMembers must fully disclose to clients, prospects, and their employers all actual and potential conflicts of interest in order to protect investors and employers. These disclosures must be clearly stated. - All, actual, potential clients\n\n\n\nThe requirement that all potential areas of conflict be disclosed allows clients and prospects to judge motives and potential biases for themselves. Disclosure of broker/dealer market-making activities would be included here. Board service is another area of potential conflict.\nThe most common conflict which requires disclosure is actual ownership of stock in companies that the member recommends or that clients hold.\nAnother common source of conflicts of interest is a member’s compensation/bonus structure, which can potentially create incentives to take actions that produce immediate gains for the members with little or no concern for longer-term returns for the client. Such conflicts must be disclosed when the member is acting in an advisory capacity and must be updated in the case of significant change in compensation structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102055636988\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102055643014\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102055649775\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102055654371\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment transactions for clients and employers must have priority over investment transactions in which a Members or Candidates is the beneficial owner.\n\n\nClient transactions take priority over personal transactions and over transactions made on behalf of the member’s firm. Personal transactions may be undertaken only after clients and the member’s employer have had an adequate opportunity to act on a recommendation. Note that family member accounts that are clients accounts should be treated just like any client account; they should not be disadvantaged.\n\n\n\nThe following areas should be included:\n\nLimited participation in equity IPOs. Members can avoid these conflicts by not participating in IPOs.\nRestrictions on private placements.\nEstablish blackout/restricted periods\nReporting requirements. Supervisors should establish reporting procedures, including duplicating trade confirmations, disclosure of personal holdings/beneficial ownership positions, and preclearance procedures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102060055431\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102060059966\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImpartiality, full cost of service -> disclosed by written\n\n\n\nimage-20211102060135980\n\n\n\n\nMembers must inform employers, clients, and prospects of any benefit received for referrals of customers and clients, allowing them to evaluate the full cost of the service as well as any potential partility.\n\n\n\nAt least quarterly, the nature and value of referral compensation received\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102060257524\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102060302176\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062029961\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must not engage in any conduct that compromises the reputation or integrity of CFA Institute or the CFA designation or the integrity, validity, or security of CFA Institute programs.\nIt is not intended to prevent anyone from expressing any opinions or beliefs concerning CFA Institute or the CFA program.\nThis Standard applies to conduct which includes:\n\nCheating on the CFA exam or any exam administered by CFA Institute (e.g., CIPM).\nRevealing anything about either broad or specific topics tested, content of exam questions, or formulas required or not required on the exam.\nNot following rules and policies of any CFA Institute program.\nGiving confidential information on the CFA program to candidates or the public.\nImproperly using the designation to further personal and professional goals.\nMisrepresenting information on the Professional Conduct Statement (PCS) or the CFA Institute Professional Development Program.\n\nMembers and candidates are not precluded from expressing their opinions regarding the exam program or CFA Institute but must not reveal confidential information about the CFA program.\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102060813503\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102060819550\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102062758264\n\n\nMembers and Candidates must not misrepresent or exaggerate the meaning or implications of membership in CFA Institute, holding the CFA designation, or candidacy in the CFA Program.\n\n\nDo not:\n\nOver-promise individual competence\nOver-promise investment results in the future\n\n\n\n\n\nSign PCS annually\nPay CFA Institute membership dues annually\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102061041020\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102061846251\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211102061851269"

One of the most important questions you can ask yourself to help figure this out is this:\n\nIs this value missing because it wasn’t recorded or because it doesn’t exist?\n\nIf a value is missing becuase it doesn’t exist (like the height of the oldest child of someone who doesn’t have any children) then it doesn’t make sense to try and guess what it might be. These values you probably do want to keep as NaN. On the other hand, if a value is missing because it wasn’t recorded, then you can try to guess what it might have been based on the other values in that column and row. This is called imputation.\nIf you’re doing very careful data analysis, this is the point at which you’d look at each column individually to figure out the best strategy for filling those missing values.\n\n\n\nIf you’re in a hurry or don’t have a reason to figure out why your values are missing, one option you have is to just remove any rows or columns that contain missing values. (Note: I don’t generally recommend this approch for important projects! It’s usually worth it to take the time to go through your data and really look at all the columns with missing values one-by-one to really get to know your dataset.)\nIf you’re sure you want to drop rows with missing values, pandas does have a handy function, dropna() to help you do this.\n\n\n\nWe can use the Panda’s fillna() function to fill in missing values in a dataframe for us. One option we have is to specify what we want the NaN values to be replaced with.\nI could also be a bit more savvy and replace missing values with whatever value comes directly after it in the same column. (This makes a lot of sense for datasets where the observations have some sort of logical order to them.)\n# replace all NA's the value that comes directly after it in the same column, \n# then replace all the remaining na's with 0\nsubset_nfl_data.fillna(method='bfill', axis=0).fillna(0)\n\n\n\n# TODO: Your code here!\nsf_permits.head()\n# TODO: Your code here!\npercent_missing = sf_permits.isnull().sum().sum() / np.product(sf_permits.shape) * 100\n\n# Check your answer\nq2.check()\n\n\n\nimage-20211002030542339\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002030629934\n\n\n# TODO: Your code here\nsf_permits_with_na_dropped = sf_permits.dropna(axis=1)\n\ndropped_columns = len(sf_permits.columns) - len(sf_permits_with_na_dropped.columns)\n\n# Check your answer\nq5.check()\n# TODO: Your code here\nsf_permits_with_na_imputed = sf_permits.fillna(method='bfill', axis=0).fillna(0)\n\n# Check your answer\nq6.check()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nin scaling, you’re changing the range of your data, while\nin normalization, you’re changing the shape of the distribution of your data.\n\n\n\n\nThis means that you’re transforming your data so that it fits within a specific scale, like 0-100 or 0-1.\nBy scaling your variables, you can help compare different variables on equal footing.\nNotice that the shape of the data doesn’t change, but that instead of ranging from 0 to 8ish, it now ranges from 0 to 1.\n\n\n\nNormalization is a more radical transformation. The point of normalization is to change your observations so that they can be described as a normal distribution.\nIn general, you’ll normalize your data if you’re going to be using a machine learning or statistics technique that assumes your data is normally distributed\nNotice that the shape of our data has changed. Before normalizing it was almost L-shaped. But after normalizing it looks more like the outline of a bell (hence “bell curve”).\n\n\n\n# TODO: Your code here\nscaled_goal_data = minmax_scaling(original_goal_data, ['goal'], 0, 1)\n\n# Check your answer\nq1.check()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002032243408\n\n\nNotice that at the bottom of the output of head(), you can see that it says that the data type of this column is “object”.\n\nPandas uses the “object” dtype for storing various types of data types, but most often when you see a column with the dtype “object” it will have strings in it.\n\nIf you check the pandas dtype documentation here, you’ll notice that there’s also a specific datetime64 dtypes. Because the dtype of our column is object rather than datetime64, we can tell that Python doesn’t know that this column contains dates.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002032324133\n\n\nYou may have to check the numpy documentation to match the letter code to the dtype of the object. “O” is the code for “object”, so we can see that these two methods give us the same information.\n\n\nWe can pandas what the format of our dates are with a guide called as “strftime directive”, which you can find more information on at this link. The basic idea is that you need to point out which parts of the date are where and what punctuation is between them. There are lots of possible parts of a date, but the most common are %d for day, %m for month, %y for a two-digit year and %Y for a four digit year.\nSome examples:\n\n1/17/07 has the format “%m/%d/%y”\n17-1-2007 has the format “%d-%m-%Y”\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002032411835\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002032419381\n\n\n\nWhat if I run into an error with multiple date formats? While we’re specifying the date format here, sometimes you’ll run into an error when there are multiple date formats in a single column. If that happens, you have have pandas try to infer what the right date format should be. You can do that like so:\n\nlandslides['date_parsed'] = pd.to_datetime(landslides['Date'], infer_datetime_format=True)\n\nWhy don’t you always use infer_datetime_format = True? There are two big reasons not to always have pandas guess the time format. The first is that pandas won’t always been able to figure out the correct date format, especially if someone has gotten creative with data entry. The second is that it’s much slower than specifying the exact format of the dates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002032513853\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the biggest dangers in parsing dates is mixing up the months and days. The to_datetime() function does have very helpful error messages, but it doesn’t hurt to double-check that the days of the month we’ve extracted make sense.\nTo do this, let’s plot a histogram of the days of the month. We expect it to have values between 1 and 31 and, since there’s no reason to suppose the landslides are more common on some days of the month than others, a relatively even distribution. (With a dip on 31 because not all months have 31 days.) Let’s see if that’s the case:\n\n\n\nimage-20211002032619957\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacter encodings are specific sets of rules for mapping from raw binary byte strings (that look like this: 0110100001101001) to characters that make up human-readable text (like “hi”). There are many different encodings, and if you tried to read in text with a different encoding than the one it was originally written in, you ended up with scrambled text called “mojibake” (said like mo-gee-bah-kay). Here’s an example of mojibake:\næ–‡å—åŒ–ã??\nYou might also end up with a “unknown” characters. There are what gets printed when there’s no mapping between a particular byte and a character in the encoding you’re using to read your byte string in and they look like this:\n����������\nCharacter encoding mismatches are less common today than they used to be, but it’s definitely still a problem. There are lots of different character encodings, but the main one you need to know is UTF-8.\n\nUTF-8 is the standard text encoding. All Python code is in UTF-8 and, ideally, all your data should be as well. It’s when things aren’t in UTF-8 that you run into trouble.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002033900935\n\n\nIf you look at a bytes object, you’ll see that it has a b in front of it, and then maybe some text after. That’s because bytes are printed out as if they were characters encoded in ASCII. (ASCII is an older character encoding that doesn’t really work for writing any language other than English.) Here you can see that our euro symbol has been replaced with some mojibake that looks like “” when it’s printed as if it were an ASCII string.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002033947123\n\n\nHowever, when we try to use a different encoding to map our bytes into a string, we get an error. This is because the encoding we’re trying to use doesn’t know what to do with the bytes we’re trying to pass it. You need to tell Python the encoding that the byte string is actually supposed to be in.\nLike I said earlier, strings are UTF-8 by default in Python 3, so if we try to treat them like they were in another encoding we’ll create problems.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002034050924\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that we get the same UnicodeDecodeError we got when we tried to decode UTF-8 bytes as if they were ASCII! This tells us that this file isn’t actually UTF-8. We don’t know what encoding it actually is though. One way to figure it out is to try and test a bunch of different character encodings and see if any of them work. A better way, though, is to use the chardet module to try and automatically guess what the right encoding is. It’s not 100% guaranteed to be right, but it’s usually faster than just trying to guess.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002034205908\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002034214164\n\n\nWhat if the encoding chardet guesses isn’t right? Since chardet is basically just a fancy guesser, sometimes it will guess the wrong encoding. One thing you can try is looking at more or less of the file and seeing if you get a different result and then try that.\n\n\n\nThe good news is, since UTF-8 is the standard encoding in Python, when you save a file it will be saved as UTF-8 by default:\n\n\n\nnew_entry = sample_entry.decode('big5-tw').encode('utf-8')\n\n# Check your answer\nq1.check()\n# TODO: Load in the DataFrame correctly.\nwith open(\"../input/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us/PoliceKillingsUS.csv\", 'rb') as rawdata:\n    result = chardet.detect(rawdata.read(30000))\nprint(result)\n\npolice_killings = pd.read_csv(\"../input/fatal-police-shootings-in-the-us/PoliceKillingsUS.csv\", encoding='Windows-1252')\n\n# Check your answer\nq2.check()\n# TODO: Save the police killings dataset to CSV\npolice_killings.to_csv(\"/kaggle/working/my_file.csv\")\n\n# Check your answer\nq3.check()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002035130731\n\n\n\n\n\nWe’re going to use the fuzzywuzzy package to help identify which strings are closest to each other. This dataset is small enough that we could probably could correct errors by hand, but that approach doesn’t scale well.\n\nFuzzy matching: The process of automatically finding text strings that are very similar to the target string. In general, a string is considered “closer” to another one the fewer characters you’d need to change if you were transforming one string into another. So “apple” and “snapple” are two changes away from each other (add “s” and “n”) while “in” and “on” and one change away (rplace “i” with “o”). You won’t always be able to rely on fuzzy matching 100%, but it will usually end up saving you at least a little time.\n\nFuzzywuzzy returns a ratio given two strings. The closer the ratio is to 100, the smaller the edit distance between the two strings.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002035245766\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002035303096"

(…) 가슴이 설렌다면, 어려움과 고초를 겪어도 추구할 바가 있다면, 스타트업은 분명히 의미 있는 삶의 여정입니다.\n\n\n“사업은 남들이 된다고 해서 되는 것도 아니고, 남들이 안 된다고 해서 안 되는 것도 아니다”\n\n\n창업자의 가족은 일단 창업자를 믿어주면 좋겠습니다. 가족이 아니라도, 창업자의 아이디어를 비평할 세상 사람은 너무 많습니다. 대부분의 스타트업이 실패하므로 실패한다고 주장하면 마치 예언자처럼 보이기도 하니까요.\n\n\n창업은 창업자의 몰입과 희생을 요구합니다. 본인뿐 아니라 가족에게도 어떤 형태로든 영향을 미칩니다. 창업자의 스트레스가 가족에게 발산될 수도 있습니다. 그렇기에 창업 전에 반드시 가족과 상의를 해야 합니다. (…) 스타트업은 보통 2~3년 이내에 실패하는 경우가 대다수이므로 가족들이 2~3년 정도 인내할 수 있을지 반드시 논의하기를 권합니다.\n\n\n스타트업에서 바쁜 것이 본인을 위한 것이냐, 그리고 그 과정에서 경쟁력 있는 인재로 성장하고 있느냐가 핵심입니다.\n\n\n스타트업의 실패가 스타트업 구성원의 실패를 의미하는 것은 전혀 아닙니다. 업무 역량과 경험은 기본적으로 개인에게 축적됩니다. 그렇기에 해당 전문 영역의 일을 더 오랫동안 더 값어치 있게 할 수도 있습니다. 다시 강조하지만, 오래 일하는 것보다 성과를 내고, 본인 스스로 성장할지를 고민하는 것이 보다 유의미합니다.\n\n\n스타트업은 제조업 중심의 대기업과 다르며, 대기업의 대체제가 아니고, 스타트업이 잘할 수 있는 분야가, 즉 적합한 분야가 있다는 의미다.\n\n\n소수의 사람들이 ‘열정’, ‘몰입’ 그리고 ’될 것이라고 믿는 자세(can-do attitude)’를 가지고, 주당 수십 시간씩 집중하는 것이 스타트업 혁신의 원천이다.\n\n\n스타트업의 혁신은 시행착오의 과정으로, 소수가 팀으로 누가 시키지도 않음에도 주당 100시간씩 일하는 열정과 몰입 등을 통해서 이뤄진다. 대기업과는 전혀 다른 형태의 혁신이다.\n\n\n자영업과 스타트업의 가장 큰 차이 중 하나는, 성장 가능성이다. 스타트업은 현재 규모가 작아도 크게 성장할 가능성이 있어야만 하며, 성장했을 때 규모 또한 커야만 한다.\n\n\n스타트업의 역설적 진실\n\n\n스타트업의 성공은 비정형적이다.\n\n\n스타트업의 평균은 실패다.\n\n\n스타트업 창업자는 오늘을 살아야 한다.\n\n\n많은 창업자는 스타트업 성공 비법을 궁금해하며, 성공을 위한 마법의 레시피를 찾아 헤매기도 한다. 창업자뿐 아니라 다수 사람이 성공한 스타트업의 공통점을, 스타트업 성공의 과정을 궁금해한다. 많은 사람이 스타트업 성공 방정식이 존재한다고 믿고, 알고 싶어한다. 이런 경향은 우리나라 사람들에게 유독 강한 듯한데, 이는 어쩌면 우리가 정답을 찾는 교육을 너무 많이 받았기 때문일지도 모른다. 세상에는 정답이 없는, 혹은 열린 토론과 서로의 다름을 인정해야 하는 경우가 많은데, 우리는 그럴 때조차 은연중에 정답이 있을 것이라고 믿는 경향이 생겼을지 모른다.\n\n\n스타트업 성공이 비정형적이라는 의미는, 모든 스타트업은 저마다 개별 스토리를 갖는다는 의미이기도 하다. 즉, 저마다의 방식으로 성공한다는 의미다.\n\n\n선배에게 조언을 듣거나 경험 많은 멘토에게 멘토링을 받는 것은 타인의 성공과 실패를 간접 체험할 수 있다는 장점이 있다. 하지만 반드시 ’저 사람이 왜 저런 이야기를 할까?’를 깊이 성찰해야 한다. 조언은 개인의 특정 경험일 수 있고, 조언자가 조언을 받는 사람의 자세한 상황을 제대로 모를 것이며, 무엇보다 성공 방식은 각자 다르기 때문이다. 따라서 조언을 받는 사람은 조언의 배경과 논리를 꼼꼼히 따져보고 자신의 상황에 비추어 취사선택해야 한다. 다른 사람의 이야기를 비판적으로 수용하지 않는다면, 조언이 오히려 독이 될 수 있다.\n\n\n스타트업 성공에 관해서 “이렇게 하면 성공한다”라고 말하는 것은 “이러면 성공한 인생이다”라고 말하는 것처럼 느껴진다. 다수 대중은 남들과 비슷한 삶을 사는 것일 수 있지만, 스타트업은 소수의 삶이다. 각자의 삶을 살아야만 한다. 스타트업은 각자의 스토리로 성공하는 것이다.\n\n\n스타트업 평균은 실패이나 스타트업에 속한 개인의 평균은 성공일 수 있다.\n\n\n타인의 의견과 시선에 휘둘리지 않고, 본인의 길을 선택해도 된다. 매일 성장하고 있다는 느낌이 명확하다면, 실패하더라도 얻는 것이 분명히 있을 것이다. 우리는 각자 다른 삶을 사는 것이다.\n\n\n필자는 가진 자의 전략과 가지지 않은 자의 전략은 달라야 한다는 말을 종종 한다. 스타트업 창업자는 가지지 않는 자다. 가진 자인 대기업, 중견기업과는 달라야 한다. 다윗이 골리앗과 동일한 전략으로 싸운다면 곤란하다.\n\n\n스타트업의 장점 중 하나는, 실패해도 잃을 것이 없다는 도전, 열정, 패기다. 그렇기에 스타트업 창업자는 내일을 대비하는 것보다 오늘에 집중해서 살아야 한다. 스타트업은 보통 실패하므로 더더욱 오늘을 살아야 한다.\n\n\n스타트업은 단계적 과정을 거쳐서 성공에 이르고, 그 성공 이상을 향해서 또 나아간다. 즉, 스타트업 성공의 여정을 돌이켜보면 서로 다른 몇 개의 단계로 구분되는 경우가 많다. 단계마다 이뤄야 했던 목표나 해결해야 했던 문제들도 다르고, 그 형태나 과정은 비정형적이다. 또한 특정 단계에서 그 단계에 해당하는 고민을 풀어야만 다음 단계로 넘어갈 수 있는 경우가 많다. 더구나 다음 단계에서 어떤 문제가 나타날지 예측하는 것도 힘들다.\n\n\n스타트업 창업자는 자신이 속한 각 단계에 몰입해야 한다. 지금 주어진 문제를 해결하는 데 총력을 기울이는 것이 핵심이다. 한걸음, 한걸음 오늘 내가 할 일들을 해야 한다. 내일의 비전을 잊으면 곤란하지만, 그보다는 오늘을 살아야 한다.\n\n\n창업자는 항상 사업의 단기적·장기적 비전을 심사숙고해야 하나, 처음부터 거창한 비전을 만들기 위해서 시간과 노력을 쏟을 필요는 없다. 창업 1~2년만 지나도 창업 당시에는 상상할 수 없는 고민을 하는 경우가 더 많다.\n\n\n스타트업 창업자는 오늘 나의 삶을 집중해서 살아가는 것이기도 하다.\n\n\n스타트업의 성공은 비정형적이고, 스타트업의 평균은 실패이며, 스타트업 창업자는 오늘을 살아야만 한다.\n\n\n필자는 스타트업을 창업하는 것이나 스타트업에서 일하는 것도 다양한 커리어 중 하나라 생각한다.\n\n\n스타트업을 하기에 적합한 사람이란 정해져 있지 않다는 것이다. 스타트업의 성공 방식이 비정형적이듯이 스타트업을 해서 성공할 수 있는 사람도 정해져 있지 않다. 즉, 각자의 방식으로 성공하는 것이지, 결코 어떤 정답을 통해서 성공하는 것은 아니다.\n\n\n스타트업을 창업해서 성공하는 사람들의 유형이 다양하다고 보는 것이 바람직하다. 각자의 방식으로 승부하는 것이다.\n\n\n좋은 아이디어만으로 스타트업을 시작할 수는 있지만, 뛰어난 실행력 없이는 스타트업의 성공에 다다를 수 없다.\n\n\n스타트업 실행의 과정은 치열하기 때문에 체력도 중요하다. 학습과 실행에는 몰입의 절대적 시간이 필요하고, 그 시간은 체력전이 되기도 한다.\n\n\n학습 태도와 능력이 뛰어난 사람들이 창업해야 한다. 학습 태도가 불량하거나 학습 능력이 떨어지는 사람은 창업을 통해서 성공까지 다다르기 쉽지 않다. 스타트업은 처음부터 맞는 답을 찾아서 성공하는 것이 아니라, 시행착오와 학습의 과정을 통해서 혁신하고 성공에 다다르는 것이기 때문이다. 또한 멋지고 큰 스타트업을 만들기 위해서는 창업자가 학습해야 하는 영역이나 절대적인 학습의 양도 상당히 많다. 스타트업을 성장시키는 모든 과정에서 학습이 요구되므로 학습 태도와 능력은 스타트업 창업자에게 필수적이다.\n\n\n예비 창업자가 ’해당 사업을 성공시킬 수 있을까?’에 대한 답을 하기 위해 노력하는 과정은 큰 의미가 있다. 치열하게 고민하는 과정에서 많이 깨닫고 배울 수 있고, 이것은 원래부터 낮은 성공 가능성을 조금이나마 높이기 때문이다.\n\n\n깨달음과 함께 어느 순간 가파르게 성장하며, 그동안 투자했던 시간과 노력이 발현된다. 성장은 무한하지 않고 다시 정체기가 찾아오는 S자 학습 곡선이 지식근로자(knowledge worker)에게는 흔하다.\n\n\n단순한 노동자와 달리, 지식근로자는 몰입을 하는 경우 생산성이 몇 배 올라갈 수도 있다. 주당 100시간을 몰입하는 것은 주당 40시간보다 2.5배 많은 시간이지만 실제 5배 이상 일하는 것이다.\n\n\n스타트업은 개인이 압축 성장할 수 있는 좋은 환경을 제공한다.\n\n\n결론적으로 스타트업은 실패할 수 있지만, 스타트업의 구성원들은 성공할 수 있다. 스타트업에서 일하는 것은 많은 것을 포기하는 선택일 수도 있지만, 다른 선택보다 빠르게 성장할 수 있다는 점은 확실하며, 이로 인해 스타트업이 실패하더라도 구성원은 얼마든지 다른 기회를 찾을 수 있다.\n\n\n스타트업에 참여한 사람이 명심할 사항을 단 하나만 꼽자면, 어제보다 오늘의 내가 성장하고 있다는 느낌이 들어야 한다는 것이다. 만약 이런 느낌이 없다면, 스타트업을 그만두는 것을 숙고하는 것이 맞겠다.\n\n\n팀워크를 발휘할 수만 있다면, 공동 창업자의 역량과 경험이 개인의 그것보다 깊고 넓기에 성공 가능성이 높다. (…) 보다 중요하게는, 실행과 시행착오를 통한 학습은 말로 전달하기 쉽지 않기 때문에, 경험과 학습은 창업자 혹은 공동 창업자들에게 내재화되어야 성공 가능성이 높아진다.\n\n\n사업의 핵심이 작동하지 않으면, 아무리 많은 일을 해도 결국 실패한다. 스타트업의 평균은 실패라는 점을 기억하자.\n\n\n성공을 위해서는 이질적 특성을 가진 공통 창업자들이 상호 보완하는 것이 좋다. 물론 서로 다른 사람들이 공동 창업하는 과정은 절대 쉽지 않다. 스타트업 성공은 흔치 않다는 점을 기억하자. 절대 쉬운 일은 없다.\n\n\n<좋은 기업을 넘어 위대한 기업으로>의 저자인 짐 콜린스는 위대한 기업으로 도약한 회사들에서 공통된 특징들을 찾아냈는데, 그중 하나가 비관적인 현실을 직시하면서 미래를 낙관하는 굳은 신념을 동시에 가진 ’스톡데일 패러독스(Stockdale paradox)’였다. 현실을 냉철하고 비판적으로 바라보는 사람들은 낙관적이기 힘들고, 미래에 낙관적인 사람들은 현실에 냉혹하기 힘들다. 그렇기에 패러독스(역설)라고 부르는 것이다. 하지만 현실 직시에 능한 한 사람과 미래를 낙관하는 한 사람을 구하는 것은 좀 더 쉽다. 물론 그들이 팀으로 일하는 것은 쉽지 않겠지만 말이다.\n\n\n외로움을 함께 견디기 위해서 공동 창업을 추천한다. (…) 공동 창업을 하면, 옆에 비슷한 처지에, 고난과 실패를 함께 나눌 수 있고, 말 없이도 이해하는 사람이 있기에 큰 힘이 된다.\n\n\n공동 창업자 사이의 의견 차이는 당연하다. 오히려 의견 차이를 해소하는 과정이 생산적인가, 의사 결정을 명확하고 빠르게 할 수 있는가가 관건이다. (…) 90% 맞는 지연된 의사 결정보다 70% 맞는 빠른 의사 결정이 더 좋을 수 있다.\n\n\n공동 창업자는 문자 그대로 함께 창업을 한 사람인데, 공동 창업자에 대한 정의나 형식이 정해져 있지 않기에 해석이 다양한 편이다. 필자는 공동 창업자는 성공은 물론이고 실패까지도 함께하는 사람이라고 본다. 처음에 함께 창업을 하더라도 모두 끝까지 함께하는 것은 아니다. 성공을 함께할 사람을 찾기는 쉽겠지만, 실패를 함께할 사람은 드물다. 사업의 책임을 함께 져주는 사람이 적은 것이다.\n\n\n공동 창업자들이 해당 역량을 모두 갖추지 못한 경우에는 어떻게 해야 하는가? 사업이 진행됨에 따라서 새로운 역량이 필요한 경우에는 어떻게 해야 하는가? 이 경우에는 핵심 역량을 갖춘 핵심 인재를 영입해야 한다.\n\n\n팀과 실행력은 몰입과 학습을 통해서 지속적으로 축적할 수 있다. 스타트업의 성공 요소들 가운데 시간이 지나고 성패를 거듭함에 따라서 커지고 발전하는 유일한 것이 바로 팀의 역량이다. 팀의 역량은, 개인의 역량과 경험이 팀워크를 통해서 시너지를 내는 과정이다. 그렇기에 창업을 하고자 하는 사람은 반드시 창업 이전에 개인의 역량을 높여야만 하고, 팀워크 협업을 통해 시너지를 내는 경험을 쌓아야만 한다.\n\n\n’어떤 사업을 할 것인가?’라는 질문과 ’어떤 팀을 구성할 것인가?’라는 질문은 별개가 아닌 하나일지도 모른다.\n\n\n처음부터 외주 개발이 성공할 것이라 기대해서는 곤란하다. 외주 또한 시행착오와 학습의 과정이 필요하다. 즉, 모르는 영역이므로 배움을 얻겠다는 자세로 접근해야만 엔지니어와 협업하는 방법을 배울 수 있고, 그때가 돼야 외주로 개발이 가능하다.\n\n\n창업자 스스로 여전히 리더십에 대한 고민이 깊다면, 초기 스타트업에서는 단순하게 실행하는 것을 추천한다. 거창한 관념보다 구성원들 개개인의 관리에 집중하는 것은 단순하지만 매우 효과적인 방법이다. 초기에는 구성원들 숫자가 적을 것이고, 어떤 리더십이나 인사 체계를 갖추는 것보다 열린 마음으로 허심탄회하게 대화를 나누는 것이 가장 강력한 리더십이다.\n\n\n전도유망한 스타트업이 되더라도 창업자가 의지를 가지고 적시에 적절한 최고 경영팀을 구성해야만 위기를 맞지 않는다는 것이다.\n\n\n창업자들이 멋지고 큰 회사를 만들고 싶다는 의지가 강하다면, 성공의 바로 그 순간부터 최고 경영팀 구성에 대해 고민하기 시작해야 한다. (…) 참고로 멋지고 큰 회사를 만든 창업자들은 보통 다른 창업자들에 대한 기본적인 애정이 있다. 기업가 정신과 외로움을 함께 공유하는 일종의 동족 의식이라고 할까!\n\n\n사회적으로 굳이 많은 사람이 창업할 필요는 없다. 창업은, 또한 창업자가 스타트업을 성장시키는 것은 절대 녹록한 일이 아니며, 대부분 스타트업은 실패한다. 그렇기에 창업 전에 창업을 왜 해야 하는가에 대한 숙고는 필수다. (…) 성공은 소수가 한다. 그렇기에 돈을 벌겠다는 이유로 창업한다면, 정말 독하게 작정하면 좋겠다.\n\n\n대부분 창업을 하는 자연스러운 이유는, 창업자가 인식한 문제를 해결하기 위한 것이다. 창업자가 세상의 무언가에 문제나 불편을 느끼고, 그 문제나 불편을 해결하기 위해 효과적인 방식 중의 하나로 창업을 선택하는 것이다. 즉, 해결하고자 하는 문제나 불편이 없는데, 또한 명확한 이유도 없는데 창업하는 것은, 뭔가 앞뒤가 맞지 않은 결정인 듯하다.\n\n\n스타트업의 평균은 실패다. 따라서 창업자에게는 실패에 대한 어느 정도의 각오가 필요하다. 이는 ’실패해도 괜찮아’와 다르다. 실패를 하지 않겠다는 결의와 가깝고, “비록 실패해도 얻을 것이 있다”라는 믿음에 가깝다. 스타트업을 하는 동안에는 최선을 다해서 임해야 실패를 하더라도 배울 수 있고, 그 결과를 후회하지 않는다.\n\n\n창업 이전에 기간, 자금, 목표 등을 정하고, 공동 창업자들끼리 합의할 뿐만 아니라 가급적 자신의 가족에게도 공유할 것을 강력하게 권한다. 말을 뱉어둬야만, 창업자의 브레이크로 작동할 수 있다.\n\n\n사람들은 몰입의 중요성을 간과한다. 2가지 일을 동시에 2시간씩 4시간 하는 것보다, 1가지 일을 4시간 몰입하는 것이, 1가지는 포기하게 되지만, 다른 1가지는 2배를 넘어서 3~4배 생산적일 수도 있다는 점을 간과한다. 선택보다 중요한 것이 포기라는 지혜를 쉽게 잊어 버린다. 창업을 선택했다면, 자신의 전력을 다할 것임을 결심해야 한다. 창업과 동시에 무언가 할 수 있다고 믿는 것은, 어느 하나도 못할 가능성이 높다. 창업을 한 순간부터 스타트업의 성공에만 몰입하는 것은, 성공의 가능성을 높이기 위해서, 그리고 무엇보다 본인의 성장을 위해서 필수적이다.\n\n\n사람들은 종종 하고 싶은 일을 하는 것과 절실하게 믿고 실행하는 것의 차이를 간과한다. 창업의 시작은 하고 싶은 일을 하는 것일 수도 있지만, 성공으로의 도전은 절실하게 믿고 실행함으로써 비로소 시작된다. 절실한 믿음과 실행은 전 세계 누구에게나 똑같이 주어지는 하루 24시간 동안 선택과 집중, 그에 따른 포기를 요구한다.\n\n\n풀타임으로 전념할 때, 절박한 심정으로 매달릴 때, 배수진을 쳤을 때, 그때 새로운 길이 보이고, 이것이 성공의 초석일 수도 있다는 점이다. 하늘은 스스로 돕는 자를 돕는 것이다.\n\n\n창업자 스스로 가슴에 손을 얻고 괜찮은 것 같으면, 일단 해보는 것도 나쁘지 않다. 스타트업 자체가 시행착오를 통한 학습의 과정이다.\n\n\n필요한 사람들을 만나는 네트워킹은 원래 어렵다. 성공이 어렵듯이 의도적으로 노력을 기울여야만 한다.\n\n\n스타트업의 성공은 비정형적이라 연령에 따른 구분은 무의미하다. 각자의 삶은 칼로 두부를 자르듯이 재단할 수 없다. 창업자들마다 처한 환경도 다들 수 있다. 그렇기에 연령에 따른 창업을 고민하는 것보다는, 앞의 설명을 토대로 본인과 본인을 둘러싼 환경을 객관적으로 바라보는 기회를 가지면 좋겠다.\n\n\n사업 계획에 관해 단 하나 확실한 점이 있다면, 사업 계획대로 진행되는 사업은 절대 없다는 것이다. (…) 사업 계획의 핵심은 창업자 스스로의 생각을 정리하고 시행착오의 기준점을 만들어준다는 것이다. 시행착오의 기준점이 없다면, 시행착오를 통한 배움은 없고, 앞으로 나아갈 수도 없다. 사업 계획 시의 믿음과 가정 중에서 어떤 것이 맞았고, 어떤 것이 현실과 맞지 않은지 명확히 검증해야 한다. 그래야 다음 단계에 어떤 전략과 계획으로 접근해야 할지 알 수 있고, 결과적으로 실패 가능성을 조금이라도 줄일 수 있다. 사업 계획이라는 나침반이 없으면 창업자들은 망망대해를 떠도는 것처럼 사업을 하는 것과 같다.\n\n\n믿음과 가정은 단계적으로 검증되고, 사업도 단계적으로 발전하는 경향이 있기 때문에 사업 계획은 사업이 진행됨에 따라서 지속적으로 업데이트되어야 한다. 어떤 문제가 해결되는 순간 사업이 전혀 다른 수준으로 발전하는 경우도 있기 때문에 더더욱 사업 계획 또한 변화하고 발전해야 한다.\n\n\n사업 계획은 각 단계에서 반드시 풀어야 할 문제들에 집중해야 하고, 그것들을 풀기 위한 가정과 조건들을 다루어야 한다. 또한 다음 단계로 발전할 경우 어떤 형태로 사업이 확장될 수 있을지도 담고 있어야 한다. 사업 계획이 실행됨에 따라 그러한 가정과 예측들이 지속적으로 검증되면서 사업이 전진하는 것이다.\n\n\n사업 계획의 형식적 요소들이 왜 그렇게 구성됐는지 반드시 고민을 해야 한다. 왜 시장에 대해서, 왜 팀과 경쟁에 대해서, 왜 자금에 대해서, 왜 시대의 변화에 대해서 쓰는 것이 필요한지 고민해야 한다. (…) 보다 근본적으로, 사업에 대한 깊은 고찰이 모든 계획에 우선한다. 깊은 고찰을 문서로 표현하는 결과물이 사업 계획서인 것이다. 깊은 고찰은 사업에 필수적인 사항들을 모두 포함하게 되며, 그러면 형식과 별개로 사업 계획서가 훌륭할 수 있다. 성공 가능성이 높아질 수 있다.\n\n\n팀을 꾸리는 것은 절대적으로 시간이 많이 걸린다. 그렇기에 사업 계획과 동시에 혹은 창업 결심 이전부터 고민하고 실행하는 것이 맞다. 팀을 구성할 때 유의할 점은 업에 부합하는 팀이어야 한다는 것이다. 개별적 사업마다 필요한 역량과 경험이 다르기 때문에 어쩌면 너무 당연한 이야기다.\n\n\n추구하는 사업의 핵심을 수행할 수 없을 정도의 팀이면 곤란하겠지만, 좋은 사람이 너무 넘치는 팀이어서도 곤란한 것이다. 그래서 사업 계획에 따라 업에 부합하는 팀을 구성하기 위해서 노력해야 하고, 팀의 구성과 더불어 사업 계획을 업데이트해야 한다.\n\n\n사업 계획은 다양한 이의 도움을 받기 위한 것이기도 하다. 도움을 받기 위해서는 무슨 일을 하는지, 해당 사업을 통해서 세상이 어떻게 변하기를 바라는지 먼저 설명하는 것이 자연스럽기 때문이다.\n\n\n사업 계획서는 사업에 대한 창업자의 생각, 가정, 실행 방안 등을 담는 것이다. 사업 계획서가 투자를 받기 위해 사용되지만, 이것이 주된 목적은 아니다. 투자를 받기 위한 목적만으로 사업 계획을 쓰는 것은 틀렸다.\n\n\n창업자가 확신하지만 대다수 사람들이 손가락질하는 사업이 차라리 크게 성공할 수 있다. 보다 본질적으로, 스타트업의 성패는 비평과는 별개다.\n\n\n창업 전에 정하고 공동 창업자와 가족 등에게 공유한 중단의 조건, 즉 정한 기간과 자금으로 목표했던 바를 이뤘는지 고민해야 한다. (…) 중단의 조건을 절대 두 번은 변경하지 말고, 아무리 아쉬워도 무조건 지키는 것을 강력하게 권한다.\n\n\n사업은 단계적 검증 과정이며 계획대로 진행되지 않을 수 있기에 사업 계획의 변경은 자연스럽다. 중요한 점은, 사업 중에는 항상 성공할 것이라고 믿는 사업 계획이 있어야만 한다는 것이다. 창업자가 특정한 믿음과 가정을 가지고 세운 것이 사업 계획이다. 실행을 통해서 믿음과 가정의 일부가 틀렸다고 판단할 수 있고, 그것을 토대로 새롭게 사업을 계획할 수 있다. 그런데 실행을 해보니 믿었던 중요 가정이 틀렸다면? 그래서 사업 계획 자체에 성공 가능성이 없다면? 그러면 창업한지 얼마 되지 않았더라도 멈춰야 한다.\n\n\n스타트업에서는 오늘이 있어야 내일이 있다. 즉 오늘이 괜찮다는 방증이 있다면, 멈추지 않고 계속 도전해보는 것이 좋다.\n\n\n진정 강조하고 싶은 사항은, 실패한 사업을 멈추는 것은 능동적으로 고민해서 결정해야 한다는 점이다. 궁지에 몰려서 어쩔 수 없이 고민하는 것이 아니라, 궁지에 몰리기 전에 고민해야 한다. 사업을 적절하게 접겠다는 생각은 창업자 스스로를 위해서 반드시 필요하기 때문이다.\n\n\n창업자는 주기적으로 이 질문을 해보기를 권한다. ‘지금 내가 이것을 안 하고 있다면, 그럼에도 이 일을 할 것인가? 왜? 어떻게?’\n\n\n스타트업은 성공을 위한 과정이지만, 적절한 시기에 폐업을 결심하고 단행하는 것은 사업의 성공 못지않게 중요하다. 궁지에 몰린 파산은 창업자 스스로를 위해서도 좋지 않다. 또한 창업자들이 재도전을 하거나 다른 스타트업에서 활기차게 일하는 것이 우리가 속한 사회나 스타트업 생태계의 장기적 관점에서도 이익이다. 스타트업의 평균은 실패다. 당연히 폐업은 흔할 수밖에 없다. 창업자가 능동적이고 주기적으로 폐업을 고민하는 것은 결코 비겁한 일이 아니다.\n\n\n사업의 굵직한 부분은 베끼기가 쉽지만, 제품의 디테일이나 운영의 탁월한 등은 베끼기 어렵다. 제품과 운영의 완벽을 추구하는 집착과 구현 능력은 외부에서는 파악하기도 힘들다. 그렇기에 실행력이 강한 스타트업 팀은 대기업과 경쟁에서 쉽게 밀리지 않는다.\n\n\n해외에서 성공했다고 한국에서 성공하는 것도, 한국에서 성공했다고 해외에서 성공하는 것도 아니다. 나라마다 문화, 인프라, 환 인식 등의 차이가 존재하고, 이는 사업 성패를 크게 좌우한다.\n\n\n트렌드에 휘말리는 창업은 그 자체가 문제다. 트렌드와 무관하게, 창업자가 강하게 믿는 분야를 뚝심 있게 밀고 가는 것이 낫다. 스타트업은 본인의 스토리로 성공하는 것이다. 남들이 안 믿는 것이 성공할수록 더욱 크게 성공한다.\n\n\n평소 대화를 많이 나누더라도 서로의 생각을 완전히 이해하는 것은 사실상 불가능하다. 그렇기에 서로에 대해 잘 모를 수 있다는 점을 인정하고, 차후 상호 이해가 깊어지고 세부 사항을 다시 협의할 수 있도록 조정 가능한 커뮤니케이션(open-ended communication) 방식으로 대화하기를 권한다.\n\n\n창업자와 투자자 간의 가치 평가에 대한 시각 차이는 어느 정도는 당연한 것이며, 이 차이를 합리적으로 맞춰가는 것이 결국 투자 과정의 일부가 된다.\n\n\n실패는 2~3년이면 알고, 성공에는 8~9년이 걸린다\n\n\n투자자를 매개로 해서 성공한 창업자가 실패한 창업자를 돕는 구조로 볼 수도 있다. 여하튼 이런 독특한 구조로 인해 새로움과 혁신을 지향하는 예비 창업자들은 평균이 실패인 스타트업에 도전하는 기회를 얻을 수 있고, 흔치는 않겠지만 아주 크게 성공할 수도 있다.\n\n\n스타트업 투자자들은 성공할 경우에는 대박이 가능한 사업을 원한다는 것이다. 다수의 실패를 소수의 성공으로 메워야 하므로 성공 가능성만큼 성공의 크기를 중요하게 여긴다. 투자자에게 안정적인 투자라고 강조하는 것은 그리 득이 되지 않는다. (…) 투자를 많이 받는다고 무조건 좋은 것은 아니라는 점이다. 많은 돈은 창업자에게 오히려 독이 될 수도 있다. 제한된 자원이 축복이 될 수 있다. 제약은 선택과 집중을 부르며, 창의성의 원동력이기도 하다.\n\n\n초기에는 창업자들 혹은 창업 팀과 같은 사람 중심의 투자 기준을, 후기에는 사업 중심의 투자 기준을 가지는 것이 보통이다.\n\n\n투자자들이 던지는 질문들에 답하려고 노력하면서 창업자들은 많이 배운다. 투자자들의 경험과 업계 네트워크를 창업자들 스스로 쌓기는 쉽지 않다. 게다가 스타트업 투자 업계는 연결되어 있기에 창업자 평판은 투자자 커뮤니티에 쉽게 퍼져 나간다."

Then, for each of these groups, we grabbed the points() column and counted how many times it appeared. value_counts() is just a shortcut to this groupby() operation.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002145008983\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002145105647\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002145157713\n\n\nAnother groupby() method worth mentioning is agg(), which lets you run a bunch of different functions on your DataFrame simultaneously. For example, we can generate a simple statistical summary of the dataset as follows:\n\n\n\nimage-20211002145227678\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002145549134\n\n\nMulti-indices have several methods for dealing with their tiered structure which are absent for single-level indices.

For technical reasons these NaN values are always of the float64 dtype.\nPandas provides some methods specific to missing data. To select NaN entries you can use pd.isnull() (or its companion pd.notnull()). This is meant to be used thusly:\n\n\n\nimage-20211002152400996\n\n\nReplacing missing values is a common operation. Pandas provides a really handy method for this problem: fillna(). fillna() provides a few different strategies for mitigating such data.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002152429049\n\n\nOr we could fill each missing value with the first non-null value that appears sometime after the given record in the database. This is known as the backfill strategy.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002152459962\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002153750555\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002153803885\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002153827767\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002153859890\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002153919768"

As members of the crowd we will always take these emotions to extremes. When the herd instinct combines with hope and fear in a market environment, we get panics and manias.\n\n\nIf you occasionally break the rules and still have an unbroken string of successes, you are likely to compound the problem because you assume that you are better than other people and above the rules. Your ego inflates, and you refuse to recognize the reality of a loss when it comes. You assume that you will be right. You assume that even if the market is against you, it will come back. Well, if I had an ego problem at one million dollars, what kind of problem would I have had if I had ridden through the valley of death and cheated death? If I had survived the loss and the market had gone on to make money for me, my ego problem would have been much worse.\n\n\nWhen dealing with the risk of the uncertainty of the future, you have three choices: engineering, gambling, or speculating.\n\n\nThe engineer knows everything he needs to know for a technologically satisfactory answer to his problems. He builds safety margins into his calculations to eliminate any fringes of uncertainty.\n\n\nThe gambler, on the other hand, knows nothing about the event on which the outcome of his gambling depends because the distinguishing feature of gambling is that it deals with the unknown. The gambler plays for the excitement—the adrenaline rush. He isn’t playing to win—he is just playing.\n\n\nThe speculator doesn’t have the advantage of the engineer. The rules of natural science will not render the future direction of prices predictable. But the speculator does know more than the gambler because while the gambler is dealing with pure chance, the speculator has at least some knowledge about what determines the outcome of his activity. Speculating is the application of intellectual examination and systematic analysis to the problem of the uncertain future.\n\n\nSuccessful investing is the result of successful speculation.\n\n\nFederal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan put it this way: “The historic purpose of banking is to take prudent risks through the extension of loans to risk taking businesses.”5 In other words, the bankers are speculating.\n\n시장에 참여하는 것은(포지션을 갖는 것은) 모두 의사결정이다. 성공적인 의사결정은 사전 플랜, 플랜에 대한 복종과 끊임없는 분석으로 이루어진다. 이는 기계적인 의사결정으로도 볼 수 있다. 성공적인 의사결정을 위해서는 반드시 플랜이 있어야 한다. 그리고 플랜은 구체적인 진입과 탈출 규칙이 있어야 한다. 특히 탈출 규칙이 없다면 해당 플랜은 아무 의미가 없다.\n플랜을 만들고, 철저히 지키고, 사후적으로 분석을 더한다고 해도 플랜은 절대 성공적인 의사결정을 않는다. 성공적인 플랜은 제한된 손실 만을 보장한다. 플랜은 손실을 제한함으로써 지속(continuous) 게임인 투자에서 투자자가 시장에 오래 남아 계속해서 게임에 참여할 수 있도록 한다.\n시장이 왜 오르는지, 왜 내리는지 알아도 돈을 잃을 수 있다. 계획이 없다면 모든 움직임을 내재화 하면서 감정적인 결정을 내리면서 결국 심리적인 요인으로 돈을 잃게 될 것이다. 그래서 반드시 구체적인 탈출 규칙을 가진 계획을 가질 때만 시장에 포지션을 가지고 있어야 한다.\n투자와 사업은 비슷한 면을 갖는다. 굉장히 다양한 요소가 작용해서 상승과 하락을 결정하고, 모든 과정이 의사결정 과정이며, 성공적인 의사결정을 위해서는 반드시 플랜이 있어야 한다. 그리고 한 순간의 성공 또는 실패를 내재화 하는 순간 모든 의사결정 과정은 감정적 의사결정으로 변하게 된다. 한 순간의 움직임은 그저 과정일 뿐, 절대 실패나 성공을 내재화 하지 마라.\n투자와 사업에서 성공하는(돈을 버는) 방법은 수도 없이 많고 다양하다. 하지만 실패하는 방법은 단 하나다. 성공적인 의사결정을 위한 플랜을 세우지 않아 모든 현상(결과)를 내재화하고, 감정적인 의사결정이 반복되면서 제어되지 못한 손실이 쌓이면서 실패한다.\n투자에서는 성공은 오로지 돈을 버느냐, 잃느냐에 달려있다. 중요한 건 왜 돈을 벌었는지, 왜 돈을 잃었는지 모른다면, 이는 반드시 감정적 의사결정으로 이어지고 파멸적인 결과를 맞이하게 된다는 것이다.\n\n“Broadly speaking, the decision-making process is as follows: (1) Decide what type of participant you’re going to be, (2) select a method of analysis, (3) develop rules, (4) establish controls, and (5) formulate a plan. Depending on what your goals or objectives are on the continuum of conservative to aggressive, you will decide whether you are an investor or speculator, which in turn will help you decide what markets to participate in, what method of analysis you’ll use, what rules you’ll develop, what controls you’ll have, and how you will implement these things with a plan. We already know that no single analytical method will be successful for everyone.”\n\n\n“Remember, participating in the markets is about making decisions, and as Drucker reminds us, “There is no perfect decision. One always has to pay a price which might mean passing up an opportunity.””\n\n\n“you can’t calculate the probability of a trade’s being profitable; you can only calculate your exposure. So all you can do is manage your losses, not predict profits.”\n\n\n“Remember, there are as many ways to make money in the markets as there are participants. There are also as many possible plans as there are participants, yet only one valid recipe for formulating a plan.”\n\n\n“Regardless of the methodology used, before you decide to get into the market you have to decide where (price) or when (time) or why (new information) you will no longer want the position.”\n\n\n“to be effective as a loss-control tool, the plan must be derived by deciding STOP, ENTRY, then PRICE OBJECTIVE.”\n\n\n“Knowing why doesn’t get you any brownie points with the market. Nor do you get any partial credit like you did in school for knowing why you got a math question wrong. And this is true for all business, not just the markets.”\n\n\n“So you can be right and lose money. But which is more important? Remember, there are two kinds of reward in the world: recognition and money. Are you being motivated by the prophet motive or the profit motive? In the markets and in business don’t concern yourself with being right. Instead, follow your plan and watch the money.”\n\n\n“Preoccupation with being right means you’re betting, which personalizes the market and is the root of losses due to psychological factors. Concern yourself with whether you have done your homework to define a set of conditions under which you will enter and exit the market and whether you carry out that plan.”\n\n\n“As my mom used to say, “Weak is he who allows his actions to be controlled by his emotions, and strong is he who forces his actions to control his emotions.””\n\n\n“Since your timing will in all likelihood never be perfect, the market would have been against you at some point, providing you plenty of opportunity to make an emotional decision and lose money. You must have a means to remove yourself from “subjectively experiencing” the market while making decisions.”\n\n\n“All effective decision making requires maintaining one’s objectivity through the use of a plan, regardless of the type of decision being made.”\n\n\n“In his book Teaching Thinking, internationally renowned education expert Edward de Bono says, “A person will use his thinking to keep himself right. This is especially true with more able pupils whose ego has been built up over the years on the basis that they are brighter than other pupils. Thinking is no longer used as an exploration of the subject area but as an ego support device.””\n\n\n“When people personalize a string of successes (or profits) and an unfolding failure (or loss) develops, having come to believe they are infallible, they use all their intelligence as an ego-support device to prove that they are right, rather than as a means to determine an appropriate course of action.”\n\n\n“When people personalize losses, they use their thinking to protect themselves, thereby rationalizing holding onto the position and distorting facts to support their view that they are “right,” not “wrong.””\n\n\n“Remember, participating in the markets is not about egos and being right or wrong (i.e., opinions and betting), and it’s not about entertainment (i.e., excitement and gambling). Participating in the markets is about making money; it’s about decision making implemented by a plan. And if implemented properly, it’s actually quite boring waiting for your buy/ sell criteria to materialize. The minute it starts getting exciting, you are gambling.”\n\n\n“Remember, Edison didn’t take the failures or losses personally, and he succeeded brilliantly (no pun intended). If, unlike Edison, you take the failures personally or, like Henry Ford, you take the successes personally, you are setting yourself up for disaster.”\n\n\n“Having and following a plan doesn’t guarantee success, nor does it make you infallible. However, a plan is necessary for consistent loss control.”\n\n\n“Take the loss, and don’t worry about it. Sticking to the discipline of your plan enables you to stay when you have a good situation and forces you to forfeit the ante when you don’t. If you drop your discipline and try bluffing, you’re exposing yourself to losing all of your money.”\n\n\n“If you don’t know what is making the profitable trades profitable, you won’t know what to repeat in order to repeat the profits (or avoid losses). Your profits won’t be linked to any specific behavior on your part. This means you’re only going to be allowed to make a bad decision once—and you know you will do it at least once. You don’t know if it will be this time, next time, or the time after that. But you will do it. And if you bluff, you will lose your money.”\n\n\n“We all know we shouldn’t smoke; a lot of us still do. We know we shouldn’t drink; a lot of us still do. We know we shouldn’t drive over the speed limit; a lot of us do. Why do we do all these things that are not good for us and that we know are not good for us? Well, because they feel good.” (…) “When it comes to the markets you’re supposed to do what feels good.”\n\n\n“There is an inverse relationship between your threshold of pain and success in the markets, so as soon as you feel the pain: get out.”\n\n\n“Goizueta didn’t personalize his previous successes, so he was able to recognize and accept the “loss.” He didn’t make the matter an issue of personal pride and choose to fight to the bitter end. He recognized it as a losing proposition to eliminate the original formula altogether. He cut his losses and moved on.”\n\n\n“Remember, you don’t get any money just because you know why the market is going up or down. You only get money if your plan has positioned you to capitalize on the market’s movement, regardless of whether you know why the market is up or down on a particular day.”\n\n\n“What’s true about the markets is also true for business in general. Just as there are many ways to make money in the markets, there are many ways to make money in business.”\n\n\n“There is no single pattern to how the most successful entrepreneurs or the best managers in business make money. However, there is a common denominator among this group: rather than just taking risks, as is commonly assumed, they excel at judging, minimizing, and controlling risks.”\n\n\n“It is important to understand that they held on not because they wanted to look good, look smart, or be right. They held on because the position remained within previously defined and acceptable loss parameters. Remember, people participate in the markets—all markets—either to satisfy a need (i.e., solve a problem) or to satisfy a want (i.e., make them feel good). Managing risk solves a problem and should never be engaged in to feel good, look smart, or be right.”\n\n\n“As An Wang, founder of Wang Laboratories, said, “It is my belief that there are no ‘secrets’ to success.” 19 The formula for failure is not lack of knowledge, brains, skill, or hard work, and it’s not lack of luck; it’s personalizing losses, especially if preceded by a string of wins or profits. It’s refusing to acknowledge and accept the reality of a loss when it starts to occur because to do so would reflect negatively on you.”"

    "text": "Contents\nIn the previous experiment, we can see that GEM5 can simulate a complete system with devices and user space only programs where system services are directly provided by the simulator in syscall emulation mode (SE mode)\nIn this experiment, we are going to create and simulate a very simple system including one simple CPU core connected to a system-wide memory bus, and a single DDR3 memory channel connected to the memory bus.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\nGEM5 configuration\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nWe have already known that the components (CPUs, caches, memory, controller, buses, etc …) used in the simulated system are built from SimObjects.\nGEM5 exports all of these objects from their C++ implementation to python. So, from Python configuration script, we can create any SimObject with particular parameters and also specify the interactions between SimObjects.\n\n\nCreating a simple system configuration file\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nYou should install the Nano Text Editor by the following command\n$ sudo apt install nano\nLet’s start by changing your workplace to gem5 root directory first, then creating a new config file:\n$ cd gem5\n$ mkdir configs/eclab/lab3\n$ nano configs/eclab/lab3/simple.py\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFirstly, we should import the GEM5 library and all SimObjects that we have compiled in previous steps.\nThen, create the first SimObject named “system” inherited from system class.\nThe system object will be the parent of all the other objects in our simulated system. It contains a lot of functional information:\n\nThe physical memory ranges\nThe root clock domain\nThe root voltage domain\nThe kernel\netc.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nInheritance diagram for system class\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nNext, we create a clock domain and set the clock frequency on that domain.\nFinally, we specify a voltage domain for this clock domain.\nIn this experiment, we will use timing mode for the memory simulation, and it can have a size of 512MB.\nPlease notice that we are working with Python, so all parameters will be converted to C++ equivalent values in the instantiation process.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nWe will start with the simplest timing-based CPU. This CPU model executes each instruction in a single clock cycle to execute.\nThen, we create the system-wide memory bus. After that, cache ports will be directly connected to the membus because the system we are going to simulate does not have any caches.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nNext, we need to create the interrupt controller for the CPU and connect it to the membus.\nWe also need to create a memory controller and connect it to the membus.\nFor this system, we will use a simple DDR3 controller, and it will be responsible for the entire memory range of our system.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nGEM5’s syscall emulation mode does not emulate all of the devices in a system and focuses on simulating the CPU and memory system that all what we need.\nNow we have to create another SimObject name ‘process’ and set the processes command to the command we want to run.\nThen, create the functional execution contexts in the CPU.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe final thing we need to do is instantiate the system and begin execution.\nFirst, we create the Root object. The instantiation process goes through all of the SimObjects we have created and creates the C++ equivalents.\nOnce simulation finishes, we can inspect the state on the system.\n\n\nRunning GEM5 with simple system configuration file\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nWe have created a simple simulation script, and now we can simply run GEM5 from root directory:\nbuild/ARM/gem5.opt.configs/eclab/lab3/simple.py\n\n\n\nUntitled"

The variables in the dataset must be converted into appropriate types to further process and analyze them correctly. Before converting, values must be stripped out with prefixes and suffixes, such as currency symbols.\n\nAny outliers that are present must first be identified.\nIn practice, several techniques can be used to detect outliers in the data. Standard deviation can be used to identify outliers in normally distributed data. In general, a data value that is outside of 3 standard deviations from the mean may be considered an outlier. The interquartile range(IQR) can be used to identify outliers in data with any form of distribution.\n\n\n\nimage-20211103190305900\n\n\nThere are several practical methods for handling outliers. Outliers are simply removed from the dataset, it is known as trimming (also called truncation). When extreme values and outliers are replaced with the maximum (for large value outliers) and minimum (for small value outliers) values of data points that are not outliers, the process is known as winsorization.\nScaling a process of adjusting the range of a feature by shifting and changing the scale of data. Variables can have a diversity of ranges that result in a heterogeneous training dataset.\n\nNormalization is the process of rescaling numeric variables in the range of [0, 1].\nStandardization is the process of both centering and scaling the variables.\n\nNormalization is sensitive to outliers, so treatment of outliers is necessary before normalization is performed. Normalization can be used when the distribution of the data is not known. Standardization is relatively less sensitive to outliers as it depends on the mean and standard deviation of the data. However, the data must be normally distributed to use standardization.\n\n\n\n\n\nA regular expression (regex) is used to for patterns of interest in a given text.\n\nRemove html tags\nRemove punctuations\nRemove numbers\nRemove white spaces\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211103190750107\n\n\n\n\n\nToken is equivalent to a word, and tokenization is the process of splitting a given text into separate tokens.\n\n\n\nimage-20211103190831842\n\n\nSimilar to structured data, text data also require normalization.\n\nLowercasing\nStop words - 검색시 검색용어로 사용하지 않는 언어\nStemming is the process of converting inflected forms of a word into its base word (known as stem). - 어간 추출\nLemmatization - 표제어 추출\n\n\n\nimage-20211103190933331\n\n\n\nAfter the cleansed text is normalized, a bag-of-words is created.

POS tags can be useful for separating verbs and nouns for text analytics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211103191936444\n\n\n\n\n\nSupervised or unsupervised learning - For supervised learning typical methods of choice are regression, ensemble trees, support vector machines and neural networks. Supervised learning would be used, for example, for default prediction based on high-yield corporate bond issuer data. For Unsupervised learning, common methods are dimensionality reduction, clustering, and anomaly detection. Unsupervised learning, for example, would be used for clustering financial institutions into different groups based on their financial attributes.\nType of data - For numerical data classification and regression tree (CART) methods may be suitable. For text data, such methods as generalized linear models (GLMs) and SVMs are commonly used. For image data, NNs and deep learning methods tend to perform better than others. For speech data, deep learning methods can offer promising results.\nSize of data - A typical dataset has two basic characteristics: number of instances and number of features. SVMs have been found to work well on ‘wider’ datasets with 10000 to 100000 features and with fewer instances. Conversely, NNs often work better on ‘longer’ datasets, where the number of instances is much larger than the number of features.\n\nOnce a method is selected, certain method-related decisions need to be made. These decisions include the number of hidden layers in a neural network and the number of trees in ensemble methods (discussed later in the sub-section on tuning).\nBefore model training begins, in the case of supervised learning the master dataset is split into three subsets used for model training and testing purposes. The first subset, a training set used to train the model, should constitute approximately 60% of the master dataset. The second subset, a cross-validation set (or validation set) used to tune and validate the model, should constitute approximately 20% of the master dataset. The third subset is a test set for testing the model and uses the remaining data. A commonly recommended split ratio is 60:20:20.\nClass imbalance,where the number of instances for a particular class is significantly larger than for other classes, may be a problem for data used in supervised learning because the ML classification method’s objective is to training a high-accuracy model.\n\n\n\nimage-20211103203955344\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211103193126872\n\n\n\n\n\n\nError analysis - confusion matrix\n\n\n\nimage-20211103193148867\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\n\\text{precision P} = TP / (TP + FP) \\\\\n\\text{recall R} = TP / (TP + FN) \\\\\n\\text{accuracy} = (TP + TN) / (TP + FP + TN + FN) \\\\\n\\text{F1 score} = (2 * P * R) / (P + R)\n\\]\n\n\n\nimage-20211103202917731\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211103202924348\n\n\n\nReceiver operating characteristics (ROC)\n\n\\[\n\\\\\n\\text{False positive rate FFR} = FP / (FP + TN) \\\\\n\\text{True positive rate TPR} = TP / (TP + FN)\n\\]\nArea under the curve (AUC) is the metric that measures the area under the ROC curve.\n\n\n\nimage-20211103193417230\n\n\n\nRoot mean squared error (RMSE)\n\n\\[\n\\\\\nRMSE = \\sqrt{\\sum^{n}_{t = 1}{\\frac{(\\text{Predicted}_{i} - \\text{Actual}_{i})^{2}}{n}}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nParameters\nHyperparameters\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211103193856273\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211103203627677\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211103203635992\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\nTF = \\text{Word count in sentence} / \\text{Total words in sentence}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\nDF = \\text{Sentence Count with word} / \\text{Total number of sentences}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\nIDF = log(1 / DF)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf scenario analysis and decision trees\n\n\n\nDetermine “probabilistic” variables\nDefine probabilistic distributions for these variables\n\nhistorical data\ncross sectional data\nstatistical distribution and parameters\n\nCheck for correlation across variables\nRun the simulation\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211103194248762\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGarbage in, garbage out\nReal data may not fit distributions\nNon-stationary distribution\nChanging correlation across inputs\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelective versus full risk analysis - In the best-case/worst-case scenario analysis, we look at only three scenarios (the best case, the most likely case, and the worst case) and ignore all other scenarios.

Scenario analysis, on the other hand, will always be a complement to risk-adjusted value, since it does not look at the full spectrum of possible outcomes."

Managers with higher rates of alpha decay (e.g., managers trading on daily new flow) need to trade in shorter time frames; therefore, they have greater trade urgency. Other managers (e.g., managers with insights based on long-term company fundamentals) will have lower rates of alpha decay and therefore a lower trade urgency.\nTo minimize information leakage (i.e., alert the market to the security mispricing through their trading activity), managers may execute their trade in multiple venues. This may include less transparent venues called dark pools, which are trading systems with low pretrade transparency. Orders entered into a dark venue cannot be seen by other market participants before the trade occurs; hence, users know that there is no risk of information leakage. The disadvantage of dark pools is that traders can’t see orders on the other side of the trade, so they do not know the pretrade likelihood of execution. An execution venue with high pretrade transparency is called a lit venue. National stock exchanges are examples of lit venues."

To avoid cash drag, a manager may engage in equitization strategies where liquid securities such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or derivatives are used to gain market exposure while the investment in underlying securities occurs over time.\nClient redemptions are usually based on the fund’s net asset value (NAV) using the closing prices of securities."

This is usually required for large trades (known as block trades), since finding the other side to larger trades is more difficult, or in less liquid markets. High-touch approaches include:\n\nPrincipal trades (broker risk trades) - This is where dealer or market makers assume all or some of the risk relating to executing the order, which is priced into their spread. Quote-driven, over-the-counter (OTC), or off-exchange markets (real estate market이라고 생각하면 편함) are primarily principal trade markets. Principal trades also include request-for-quote (RFQ) markets where market makers do not provide continuous quotes, but only do so on request.\n\nbroker가 거래를 떠안음\nQuote-driven market = price-driven market = dealer market → dealer가 주도\n\nAgency trades - This is where the broker finds the other side of the trade, and risk for order execution remains with the portfolio manager/trader.\n\n\ntoo low liquidity\nlarge volume\ntoo urgent\n\n\n\nElectronic trading\nElectronic trading involves trading via computer and is used in more liquid markets. Trading here is typically order driven in that electronic systems allow buyers and sellers to advertise their limit orders in a central limit order book. Electronic trading generally involves direct market access (DMA) and/or algorithmic trading. DMA allows buy-side portfolio managers/traders to access the order book of the exchange directly through a broker’s technology infrastructure.\n\norder-driven market = auction market\n구매자 주도\nDMA는 1) when urgent 2) small trades\n\n\n\nAlgorithmic trading\nAlgorithmic trading is the use of programmed rules to electronically trade orders, primarily used for two purposes: profit seeking and trade execution.\nProfit-seeking algorithms use real-time market data to determine which securities to buy and sell, and are employed by electronic market makers, quantitative funds, and high-frequency traders.\n\n좋은 가격에 거래 할 수 있을까?\n\nExecution algorithms trade according to the rule specified by the manager to meet their objectives.\n\n전부 체결할 수 있을까?\n\nScheduled algorithms-percent-of-volume (POV), VWAP, and TWAP algorithms. These execute trades using rules driven by historical volumes or specified time periods.\n\nPOV algorithms (a.k.a. participation algorithms) send orders according to a volume participation schedule (e.g., “participate as 5% of traded volume”).\n\nAdvantage: They automatically exploit increased liquidity when available.\n\ncheap and efficient\n\nDisadvantage: They continue to trade at any (potentially adverse) price, and may not fill the order in a specified time if there is a lack of trading.\n\nVWAP and TWAP algorithms are time-scaling algorithms. VWAP algorithms attempt to match the VWAP price for the period by carving up the trade and sending orders based on historical intraday volumes. The usual intraday volume profile is to trade more at the open and close and less in the middle of the day. TWAP algorithms perform a similar task; however, they ensure an equal number of shares is traded in each time period (e.g., each hour).\n\nAdvantage - They ensure that a specified number of shares are executed in a specified time period.\nDisadvantage - They may force trades in times of low liquidity or trade too little in times of high liquidity.\n\n\nLiquidity-seeking algorithms (a.k.a. opportunistic algorithms) aim to take advantage of favorable liquidity conditions when offered by the market. For example, for a buyer, this algorithm would wait until a larger seller appeared and then enter a market order. These order use both lit and dark venues.\nArrival price algorithms seek to trade close to market prices prevailing at the time the order is entered. These algorithms will trade more aggressively (i.e., faster) than other algorithms to trade more shares at close to the arrival price.\nDark strategies/liquidity aggregators execute trades in dark pools, with aggregator algorithms attempting to optimize trading across multiple dark venues.\nSmart order routes (SORs) are algorithms that determine the best destination (either lit or dark) to route an electronic order to get the best result. SORs focus on getting the best price for market orders, or the highest probability of execution for limit orders."

Equity markets are the most technologically advanced, with most of the trading executed electronically, and the use of algorithms is commonplace.\n\n\nFixed-income markets\nFixed-income markets tend to trade in a large number of heterogeneous securities, as many issuers have multiple issues outstanding. While the fixed-income markets tend to have low liquidity, typical order size is large. Due to these characteristics, trading is mostly conducted in dealer-based, quote-driven markets. Electronic RFQ systems are becoming more common; however, algorithmic trading is largely limited. Other fixed-income securities markets generally use high-touch execution methods-urgent trades would require a principal broker risk trade, while less urgent trades would use a broker-agent approach.\n\n\nDerivatives\nElectronic trading is common for exchange-traded derivatives. Algorithmic trading is not as common as for equities markets, and is used more for futures than for options. Buy-side traders generally use DMA.\n\n\nOTC derivatives\nOTC derivatives trading takes place in a dealer quote-driven market, usually implemented through high-touch approaches.\n\n\nSpot foreign exchange\nSpot foreign exchange trading takes place in OTC markets that use both electronic trading and high-touch broker approaches. The market works in three tiers: interbank, interdealer, and bank-to-client, with decreasing trade sizes and increasing spreads, respectively. For large urgent trades, RFQs are used with brokers. For large non-urgent trades, scheduled algorithms or high-touch agency approaches are used. Small trades are usually implemented using DMA.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

Together, the investment committee and the internal investment staff would be referred to as the fund sponsor. Conducting a performance attribution on the decisions made by the fund sponsor is called a macro attribution.\nThe BHB and the BF model attributions in the previous section were macro attributions. They looked at the value added through the decisions made by the sponsor to overweight/underweight different styles of manager versus the benchmark and the value added by the sponsor’s ability to select good managers in these styles.\nFurther down the investment decision-making structure are individual portfolio managers (either internal or external to the endowment) making decisions to overweight/underweight segments (e.g., substyle/sector/geography) of their portfolio to generate an active return. A performance attribution applied to these decisions made at the individual investment-manager level is called micro attribution.\nUsing the BF model, the allocation effect for a micro attribution calculates the allocation effect of the size bets made by the growth and value managers. Recall that the allocation effect is calculated as:\n\\[\n\\text{allocation effect, } A_{i} = (w_{i} - W_{i}) \\times (B_{i} - B)\n\\]\nRecall that the selection effect is formulated as:\n\\[\nS_{i} = W_{i} \\times (R_{i} - B_{i})\n\\]\nRecall that the interaction effect is formulated as:\n\\[\nI_{i} = (w_{i} - W_{i}) \\times (R_{i} - B_{i})\n\\]\nThe total allocation + selection + interaction effect is the total active return of the portfolio. Note that this is the same as the macro-attribution output.\n\ninteraction, selection을 묶어서 계산하는 경우도 있음\n\nIn later attributions, the reading presents the selection and interaction effect together rather than individually.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nWhen the micro attribution is conducted on a single stock, the allocation effect actually represents the selection effect (because an allocation to a single security is really a stock-selection decision), and the selection effect represents the market timing and transaction costs of the manager with respect to the individual security."

The negative coefficient of the benchmark’s sensitivity to SMB indicates the benchmark has a large-cap focus tilt. We can summarize the benchmark as large-cap blend (no tilt toward growth or value) that does not use momentum.\nTo analyze the investment decisions by the portfolio manager, review column 1 (portfolio) and column 3 (different between portfolio and benchmark). The portfolio exhibits a value tilt but closely resembles the benchmark on the other factors.\nThe next step in the attribution analysis is to determine if the value tilt taken by the portfolio manager added or detracted value from the portfolio. From the factor sensitivities table, the value tilt contributed 1.29%, or over 78% of the total realized active return for the portfolio. The other effects were minor compared to the value tilt taken by the portfolio manager. Finally, the portfolio manager’s effectiveness at stock picking (security selection) detracted slightly (-0.10%) from the portfolio’s returns."

The purpose of this attribution is to explain why the active return of the portfolio was 2.42% - 2.56% = -0.14%\nThe overall portfolio duration was 4.84, versus an overall benchmark duration of 3.85. This implies that the portfolio would outperform if the yield curve experienced a parallel shift down. The manager achieved this higher duration through having a higher total weight in the medium duration bucker (60%) versus the benchmark (44%).\nThe manager was overweight corporate bonds in the portfolio (65%) versus the benchmark (45%).

The manager was correct to extend the duration of the portfolio, which implies that the yield curve did indeed fall.\nConvexity: 39 bps of active return was lost due to changes in the shape of the yield curve. Because the manager was overweight higher duration assets, this suggests that medium yield rose and short yield fell. This implies a steepening of the yield curve.\nSector allocation: 8bps were lost because the manager overweighted the corporate sector. This implies that, contrary to the manager’s expectations, corporate spreads widened during the period.\nBenchmark following: the manager did not engage in active bond selection during the period."

    "text": "Benchmark alternative investments\n\nHedge funds\nThree general types of benchmarks could be considered for hedge funds: 1) broad market indexes, 2) risk-free rate, and 3) hedge fund peer universes.\nBroach market indexes are not appropriate to use as a benchmark for hedge funds because hedge funds cover a wide range of investment strategies. In addition, hedge funds differ significantly from each other and can have wide asset allocation fluctuations in the long term, which makes the use of broad market indexes problematic. With hedge funds using leverage, short positions, and derivatives-plus their overall lack of liquidity, transparency, ability to monitor, and low or no correlation of returns with the broad market index-broad market indexes should not be used as a benchmark for hedge funds.\nThe risk-free rate with an added spread could be used for some hedge fund strategies that focus on arbitrage. (risk-free rate is irrelevant to hedge fund) As a result, the spread would need to be increased accordingly. Finally, as with broad market indexes, the lack of correlation of hedge fund returns and the risk-free rate makes the risk-free rate on unsuitable benchmark.\nHedge fund peer universes are not suitable because a specific peer group’s risk and return objectives are not likely to match those of a specific hedge fund. Additionally, peer universes are subject to backfill and survivorship bias. Finally, because of the frequent illiquidity of underlying assets in hedge funds, current pricing may not be exact and may be based on an appraisal or prior period price.\n\n\nReal Estate\nMany real estate benchmarks exist but they are not all suitable for real estate investments:\n\nThe benchmarks are derived from a sample of the real estate universe, which means they are not completely representative of the real estate asset class.\nThe performance of the index probably bears a very high correlation to the largest investments.\nBenchmark returns are self-reported, so some subjectivity and/or bias may be present.\nBenchmarks that are value-based could be biased toward the most expensive properties or geographical areas.\nThere is a lack of comparability with benchmark returns given that some benchmarks use leverage while others do not.\nThe indexes assume no transaction costs, full transparency, and normal liquidity, which is usually not the case; those factors would impact actual real estate returns.\n\nAdditionally, there is lack of consistency in the use of return measures. For example, the cash inflows and outflows for open-end funds are controlled by the investor, so time-weighted returns would be used. In contrast, the cash inflows and outflows for closed-end funds are controlled by the manager, so an internal rate of return (IRR) would be used.\n\n\nPrivate equity\nThe metric used is usually IRR, taking into account all investment cash flows since inception plus the ending investment value. Key problems with such benchmarks include managers using different methods of valuation, which makes comparison more difficult. In addition, IRR may be biased by losses or gains occurring near the beginning of an investment.\n\n\nCommodities\nBenchmarks for commodity investments are usually based on futures as opposed to actual assets. This may result in significant differences between the benchmark and the commodity investments portfolio, which reduces the comparability.\n\n\nManaged derivatives\nManaged derivatives funds, often referred to as managed futures fund, use specific derivatives trading strategies to generate returns. Benchmarks are either strategy-specific or peer group-based. Peer-group benchmarks are similar those used for hedge funds and will potentially exhibit the same issues as hedge fund peer-group-based benchmarks such as survivorship bias.\n\n\nDistressed securities\nGiven the illiquidity and severe lack of marketability of distressed securities, it is almost impossible to determine an appropriate benchmark. It is likely to require a significant amount of time to occur (if it even does) and that creates valuation problem (e.g., stable pricing).\n\ntrade가 거의 없어서 real value와 market price의 괴리가 커짐\n\nThey may take into account numerous strategies so that suitability of indexes for a specific strategy is questionable. As well, the indexes may perform valuations at erratic intervals so the issue of stale pricing may not be solved."

    "text": "Type I and II Errors\nHypothesis testing can be used. The null hypothesis is that there is no value added, therefore, to demonstrate that it is value added on a statistically significant basis, the calculated test statistic would have to be large enough so that the null hypothesis would be rejected.\nAs a result, there could be a Type I error whereby the null hypothesis is rejected when in fact, there was no value added. In other words, the hired or kept manager did not demonstrate sufficient skill. Alternatively, there could be a Type II error whereby the null hypothesis is not rejected, when in fact, there was value added. In other words, the manager who was not hired or the manager who was fired did demonstrate sufficient skill.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nType I error - incorrectly reject \\(H_{0}\\) → hiring and retaining bad managers\n\n더 심각\nmeasurable, 조직이 망가짐\n\nType II error - fail to reject \\(H_{0}\\) → firing good managers\n\nnot measurable\n\nType I errors receive much more attention than Type II errors. One reason may related to the notion of regret aversion by the decision maker, which is linked to an error of commission (a Type I error). Errors of commission are active decisions that result in explicit (or visible)costs. In contrast, Type II errors are errors of omission, so they result in implicit or opportunity (less visible) costs. Another reason is that Type I errors are easier to determine; for example, a manager’s relative performance can be measured against a benchmark. Such performance also impacts the decision maker’s compensation so additional care would be taken to reduce the risk of a Type I error. In contrast, Type II errors are difficult to determine; for example, how can one objectively determine  how a manager (who was not hired) would have performed? Finally, Type I errors are much more visible to clients who can easily determine that their investments have underperformed the benchmark over a specific time period, for example."

    "text": "Costs of Type I and II errors\nType I errors result in costs associated with retaining managers who are weak, while Type II errors result in costs associated with not retaining managers who are strong. Therefore, assuming two separate groups of managers (e.g., strong and weak), the greater the differences in sample size and mean, the greater the costs of Type I and II errors. The wider the dispersion of returns between strong and weak managers, the easier it is to distinguish between their relative skills. Therefore, it makes it less likely to have a Type I or II error which results in a lower expected cost of a Type I or II error.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nIn an efficient market, the dispersion of return distributions between the two groups is probably smaller due to greater difficulty in achieving alpha through active management, which would lessen the costs of hiring or retaining weak managers (Type I error).\nIf markets are mean-reverting, then Type I errors may occur when firing a poor performer, only to have performance improve subsequently or hiring a strong performer only to have performance deteriorate subsequently (Note: That is not a Type II error because the assumption is that the poor and strong performers have been accurately determined initially but it is the mean-reversion of the markets that leads to the Type I error). Type II errors occur in mean-reverting markets when strong managers are fired or not hired (e.g., they subsequently underperform when the market goes down) or managers who have weaker short-term performance (but have sufficiently strong long-term performance) are fired or not hired and they subsequently outperform when the market goes up."

These risk premiums are the returns that are earned above the risk-free rate for bearing undiversifiable risks, also referred to as systematic or market risk. To earn risk premiums, passive strategies will target one or more specific systematic risk factors including equity risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and volatility risk.\nThere are two broad types of inefficiencies to be considered: behavioral and structural. Behavioral inefficiencies are mispricings caused by other investors and their behavioral biases (e.g., trend-following). The mispricings are very short-term in nature and therefore, must be quickly exploited (sometimes within seconds) prior to the market correction. Structural inefficiencies occur because of laws and regulations which can make them long-term in nature."

For example, hedge fund liquidity involves redemption frequency, lockup periods, notification periods, and gates.\nPrivate equity and venture capital funds have the lowest liquidity because of capital calls; investors only receive returns after about five years into the 10-year average life of the funds. The manager may extend the life of the fund for up to two one-year periods, which further lowers liquidity.\nKey advantages of limited partnership terms include ability to have a long investment horizon, thereby not allowing investors to overreact to short-term aberrations. As well, allowing for the earning of illiquidity premiums by investing in illiquid assets and not being forced to sell assets at depressed prices due to redemption requests.\nKey disadvantages of limited partnership terms include the impaired ability to change portfolio allocations in response to changes in the market.

Unfortunately, luck may play a significant role in the short-term growth of assets.

Loyalty to Clients\nMangers must:\n\nPlace client interest before their own. - Managers should take reasonable steps to avoid situations in which the Manager’s interests and client interests conflict and should institute operational safeguards to protect client interests. Managers should implement compensation arrangements that align the financial interests of clients and Managers and avoid incentives that could result in Managers taking action in conflict with client interests.\nPreserve the confidentiality of information communicated by clients within the scope of the Manager-client relationship. - The duty to maintain confidentiality does not supersede a duty (and in some cases the legal requirement) to report suspected illegal activities involving client accounts to the appropriate authorities. Where appropriate, Managers should consider creating and implementing a written anti-money-laundering policy to prevent their organizations from being used for money laundering or the financing of any illegal activities.\nRefuse to participate in any business relationship or accept any gift that could reasonably be expected to affect their independence, objectivity, or loyalty to clients. - Managers should define what the minimum value is and should confer with local regulations which may also establish limits. Managers should establish a written policy limiting the acceptance of gifts and entertainment to items of minimal value. Managers should consider creating specific limits for accepting gifts (e.g., amount per time period per vendor) and prohibit the acceptance of any cash gifts. Employees should be required to document and disclose to the Manager, through their supervisor, the firm’s compliance office, or senior management, the acceptance of any gift or entertainment.\n\n\n\nB. Investment Process and Actions\n4. Have a reasonable and adequate basis for investment decisions - Managers who implement complex and sophisticated investment strategies should understand the structure and potential vulnerabilities of such strategies and communicate these in an understandable manager to their clients. For example, when implementing complex derivative strategies, Managers should understand the various risks and conduct statistical analysis (i.e., stress testing) to determine how the strategy will perform under different conditions.\n5. When Managing a portfolio or polled fund according to a specific mandate, strategy, or style:\n\nTake only investment actions that are consistent with the stated objectives and constraints of that portfolio or fund. - When Managers are given a specific mandate by clients or offer a product such as a pooled fund for which the Managers do not know the specific financial situation of each client, the Managers must manage the funds or portfolios within the stated mandates or strategies. Clients need to be able to evaluate the suitability of the investment funds or strategies for themselves. Subsequently, they must be able to trust that Managers will not diverge from the stated or agreed-on mandates or strategies. When market events or opportunities change to such a degree that Managers wish to have flexibility to take advantage of those occurrences, such flexibility is not improper but should be expressly understood and agreed to by Managers and clients. Best practice is for Managers to disclose such events to clients when they occur or, at the very least, in the course of normal client reporting.\n\n6. When managing separate accounts and before providing investment advice or taking investment action on behalf of the client:\n\nEvaluate and understand the client’s investment objectives, tolerance for risk, time horizon, liquidity needs, financial constraints, any unique circumstances (including tax considerations, legal or regulatory constraints, etc.) and any other relevant information that would affect investment policy.\n\n\n\nC. Trading\n2. Give priority to investments made on behalf of the client over those that benefit the Managers’ own interests. - In some investment arrangements, such as limited partnerships or pooled funds, Managers put their own capital at risk alongside that of their clients to align their interests with the interests of their clients. These arrangements are permissible only if clients are not disadvantaged. Managers should develop policies and procedures to monitor and, where appropriate, limit the personal trading of their employees. In particular, Managers should require employees to receive approval prior to any personal investments in initial public offerings or private placements. Managers could require employees to provide the compliance officer with copies of trade confirmations each quarter and annual statements of personal holdings.\n\n\nD. Risk Management, Compliance, and Support\n2. Appoint a compliance officer responsible for administering the policies and procedures and for investigating complaints regarding the conduct of the Manager or its personnel. - Depending on the size and complexity of the Manager’s operations, Managers may designate an existing employee to also serve as the compliance officer, may hire a separate individual for that role, or may establish an entire compliance department. Where possible, the compliance officer should be independent from the investment and operations personnel and should report directly to the CEO or board of directors.\n3. Ensure that portfolio information provided to clients by the Manager is accurate and complete and arrange for independent third-party confirmation or review of such information. - The confirmation of portfolio information may take the form of an audit or review, as is the case with most pooled vehicles, or may take the form of copies of account statements and trade confirmations from the custodian bank where the client assets are held.\n5. Employ qualified staff and sufficient human and technological resources to thoroughly investigate, analyze, implement, and monitor investment decisions and actions. - The provision is not meant to prohibit the outsourcing of certain functions, but the Manager retains the liability and responsibility for any outsourced work.\n6. Establish a business-continuity plan to address disaster recovery or periodic disruptions of the financial markets.\n\nCommonly referred to as business-continuity or disaster-recovery planning, such preparation is increasingly important in an industry and world highly susceptible to a wide variety of disasters and disruptions.\nThe level and complexity of business-continuity planning depends on the size, nature, and complexity of the organization. At a minimum, Managers should consider having the following:\n\nadequate backup, preferably off-site, for all account information;\nalternative plans for monitoring, analyzing, and trading investments if primary systems become unavailable;\nplans for communicating with critical vendors and suppliers;\nplans for employee communication and coverage of critical business functions in the event of a facility or communication disruption; and\nplans for contacting and communicating with clients during a period of extended disruption.\n\nNumerous other factors may need to be considered when creating the plan. According to the needs of the organization, these factors may include establishing backup office and operational space in the event of an extended disruption and dealing with key employee deaths or departures.\n\n7. Establish a firmwide risk management process that identifies, measures, and manages the risk position of the Manager and its investments, including the sources, nature, and degree of risk exposure.\n\nThe key to sound risk management by Managers is seeking to ensure that the risk profile desired by clients matches the risk profile of their investments.\nAlthough portfolio managers consider risk issues as part of formulating an investment strategy, the firm’s risk management process must be objective, independent, and insulated from influence of portfolio managers. Managers may wish to describe to clients how the risk management framework complements the portfolio management process while remaining separate from that process. Managers should consider outsourcing risk management activities if a separate risk management function is not appropriate of feasible because of the size of the organization.\n\n\n\nE. Performance and Valuation\n2. Use fair-market prices to value client holdings and apply, in good faith, methods to determine the fair value of any securities for which no independent, third-party market quotation is readily available. - These conflicts may be overcome by transferring responsibility for the valuation of assets (including foreign currencies) to an independent third party. For pooled funds that have boards of directors comprising independent members, the independent members should have the responsibility of approving the asset valuation policies and procedures and reviewing the valuations. For pooled funds without independent directors, we recommend that this function be undertaken by independent third parties who are expert in providing such valuations.\n\n\nF. Disclosures\n\nDisclose the following:\n\n\nConflicts of interests generated by any relationships with brokers or other entities, other client accounts, fee structures, or other matters.\nExamples of some of the types of activities that can constitute actual or potential conflicts of interest are the use of soft dollars or bundled commissions, referral and placement fees, trailing commissions, sales incentives, directed brokerage arrangements, allocation of investment opportunities among similar portfolios, Manager or employee holdings in the same securities as clients, whether the Manager co-invests alongside clients, and use of affiliated brokers.\nRegulatory or disciplinary action taken against the Manager or its personnel related to professional conduct.\nThe investment process, including information regarding lock-up periods, strategies, risk factors, and use of derivatives and leverage.\nManagement fees and other investment costs charged to investors, including what costs are included in the fees and the methodologies for determining fees and costs.\n\nGross and net expense\nInvestors are entitled to full and fair disclosures of costs associated with the investment management services provided. Material that should be disclosed includes information relating to any fees to be paid to the Managers on an ongoing basis and periodic costs that are known to the Managers and that will affect investors’ overall investment expenses. At a minimum, Managers should provide clients with gross- and net-of-fees returns and disclose any unusual expenses.\nManagers must not only use plain language in presenting this information but must clearly explain the methods for determining all fixed and contingent fees and costs that will be borne by investors and also must explain the transactions that will trigger the imposition of these expenses.\nManagers should also retrospectively disclose to each client the actual fees and other costs charged to the clients, together with itemizations of such charges when requested by clients. This disclosure should include the specific management fee, any incentive fee, and the amount of commissions Managers paid on behalf of clients during the period. In addition, Managers must disclose to prospective clients the average or expected expenses or fees clients are likely to incur.\n\nThe amount of any soft or bundled commissions, the good and/or services received in return, and how those goods and/or services benefit the client.\nThe performance of clients’ investments on a regular and timely basis.\n\nClients may reasonably expect to receive regular performance reporting about their accounts. Without such performance information, even for investment vehicles with lock-up periods, clients cannot evaluate their overall asset allocations (i.e., including assets not held or managed by the Managers) and determine whether rebalancing is necessary. Accordingly, unless otherwise specified by the client, Managers must provide regular, ongoing performance reporting. Managers should report to clients at least quarterly, and when possible, such reporting should be provided within 30 days after the end of the quarter.\n\nValuation methods used to make investment decisions and value client holdings\n\nClients deserve to know whether the assets in their portfolios are valued on the basis of closing market values, third-party valuations, internal valuation models, or other methods.\n\nResults of the review or audit of the fund or account\nRisk management processes"

    "text": "Discretionary portfolios\nStandard 3.A.1. All actual, fee-paying, discretionary portfolios must be included in at least one composite. Although non-fee-paying discretionary portfolios may be included in a composite (with appropriate disclosures) nondiscretionary portfolios must not be included in a firm’s composites.\nFrom the wording of this Standard, it is clear that the notion of “discretionary” is key to a portfolio because it determines whether the portfolio must be included in at least one composite or if it must not be included in any composite.\nThe investment Performance Council defines discretion as “the ability of the firm to implement its intended strategy.” A client may place significant constraints on the manager-for instance, the investment policy statement (IPS) may specify limits on sectors, credit ratings, durations, et cetera. Furthermore, there may be total restrictions on certain transactions, such as the purchase of “unethical” or foreign investments, or the sale of specified stocks. These restrictions do not automatically remove the discretionary nature of the portfolio.\nA portfolio becomes nondiscretionary when the manager is no longer able to implement the intended investment strategy. If for instance the liquidity requirements are so great that much of the value must be in cash, or if the portfolio has minimal tracking limits from an index portfolio, then the description of “discretionary” is really no longer appropriate.\nStandard 3.A.1 also demonstrates that by including all fee-paying discretionary portfolios in at least one composite, managers cannot cherry-pick their best performing portfolios to present to prospective clients. Firms are permitted to include a portfolio in more than one composite, provided it satisfies the definition of each composite.\nNon-fee-paying portfolios may be included in the firm’s composites, but if they are, firms are required to disclose the percentage of composite asset represented by non-fee-paying portfolios. If the firm includes non-fee-paying portfolios in its composites, those portfolios are subject to the same rules as fee-paying portfolios.\n\n5.A.6. If a COMPOSITE includes non-fee-paying PORTFOLIOS, the FIRM MUST present the percentage of COMPOSITE assets represented by non-fee-paying PORTFOLIOS as of each annual period end.\n\nIf a portfolio’s status changes from discretionary to nondiscretionary, the portfolio may not be removed from a composite retroactively."

Composites must include all portfolios that meet the composite definition. The full composite definition must be made available on request.\n\nPortfolios may not be moved into or out of composites except in the case of valid, documented, client-driven changes in investment objectives or guidelines or in the case of the redefinition of the composite.\n4.A.3. FIRMS MUST disclose the COMPOSITE DESCRIPTION.\n4.A.11. FIRMS MUST disclose that the FIRM’S list of COMPOSITE DESCRIPTIONS is available upon request.\n\nGeneric definitions such as “equity” or “fixed income” may be too broad to enable clients to make comparisons, so qualifies such as sector, benchmark, capitalization (e.g., large, mid, small), style (e.g., value, growth, blend), or even risk-return profile may be useful.\n\n3.A.7. PORTFOLIO MUST NOT be switched from one COMPOSITE to another unless documented changes to a PORTFOLIO’S investment mandate, objective, or strategy or the redefinition of the COMPOSITE make it appropriate. The historical performance of the PORTFOLIO MUST remain with the original COMPOSITE."

    "text": "Constructing composites: adding portfolios and terminating portfolios\nStandard 3.A.2. Composites must include only assets under management within the defined firm.\nStandard 3.A.3. Firms are not permitted to link simulated or model portfolios with actual performance.\n\n5.A.4. Returns for periods of less than one year MUST NOT be annualized.\n3.A.6. Terminated portfolios must be included in the historical returns of the appropriate composites up to the last full measurement period that the portfolio was under management.\n\nStandard 3.A.5. Composites must include new portfolios on a timely and consistent basis after the portfolio comes under management.\n\nFor each individual composite, firms should have a policy for the inclusion of new portfolios. Ideally, the policy will prescribe inclusion of a new portfolio in a composite at the start of the next full performance measurement period.\n\nStandard 3.A.6. Terminated portfolios must be included in the historical returns of the appropriate composites up to the last full measurement period that the portfolio was under management.\n\nRemaining the performance of a terminated portfolio through its final full period helps alleviate the effects of survivorship bias. For example, the composite for that quarter is reported, the performance of the terminated portfolio must be included. However, presenting an annual return for a terminated portfolio with less than a full year’s performance (e.g., creating an annual return from less than four quarter returns) is not allowed.\n5.A.4. Returns for periods of less than one year MUST NOT be annualized.3.A.6. Terminated portfolios must be included in the historical returns of the appropriate composites up to the last full measurement period that the portfolio was under management.\n\nStandard 3.A.7. Portfolios must not be switched from one composite to another unless documented changes in client guidelines or the redefinition of the composite make it appropriate. The historical record of the portfolio must remain with the original composite.\n\nEven if investment strategies change over time, firms usually do not change the definition of a composite. Rather, changes in strategy typically result in the creation of a new composite. In the rare case that it is deemed appropriate to redefine a composite, the firm must disclose the date and nature of the change. Changes to composite definitions must not be applied retroactively.\n3.A.4. COMPOSITES MUST be defined according to investment mandate, objective, or strategy. COMPOSITES MUST include all PORTFOLIOS that meet the COMPOSITE DEFINITION. Any change to a COMPOSITE DEFINITION MUST NOT be applied retrospectively. The COMPOSITE DEFNITION MUST be made available upon request.\n\nStandard 3.A.9. If a firm sets a minimum asset level for portfolios to be included in a composite, no portfolios below that asset level can be included in that composite.\n\nDefinition recommends that a policy be put in place to identify percentage or period of branches after which a portfolio should be removed from the composite. For instance, a portfolio may have to be removed after falling more than 10% below the limit or after being below the limit at the start of three successive periods.\nNote that the performance history for a composite may not be adjusted as a result of a constituent portfolio being removed, and composite definitions may not be changed retroactively.\n\nStandard 3.A.10. A portfolio could receive a significant external cash flow (defined as a cash flow large enough that the portfolio temporarily does not reflect the composite’s style). The recommendation is to put the cash in a temporary new account that is not part of the composite until the funds are invested in accordance with the style. At that time the temporary new account should be merged into the existing account. Only if this is not possible should the account be temporarily removed from the composite until the account again reflects the composite style.\n\n3.B.2. To remove the effect of a SIGNIFICANT CASH FLOW, the FIRM SHOULD use a TEMPORARY NEW ACCOUNT.\n\nStandard 3.B.2. To remove the effect of significant cash flows, firms should use temporary new accounts.\n\nSignificant cash flows are external cash flows directed by a client that are large enough to disrupt the management of the composite. In the case of significant inflows, the firm is encouraged to create a separate account until the funds can be invested according to the composite strategy. When the client directs a significant withdrawal, the firm is encouraged to establish a securities account separate from the composite until the securities can be liquidated and the cash distributed."

Total returns must be used.\n\nIncome and unrealized capital gains (losses) must be included in computing total returns. Given that assets could be sold to realize their increased value, it would make no sense just to show realized gains.\n\nStandard 2.A.2. Time-weighted rates of return that adjust for external cash flows must be used.\n\nFor periods beginning January 1, 2005, firms must use approximated rates of return that adjust for daily weighted external cash flows. (Modified Dietz)For periods beginning January 1, 2010, firms must value portfolios on the date of all large external cash flows.\nA time-weighted rate of return (TWRR), computed using a minimum of monthly valuations and adjusting for cash flows. Subperiod returns must be geometrically linked.\n\nIt is important to note that dividend payments and interest income are not considered cash flows that require adjustments because (unless stated) they are retained within the portfolio.\nThe basic holding period return formula may also be used to calculate subperiod returns with the daily valuation method, where daily subperiod returns are geometrically linked to produce the total return for the period. Until January 1, 2010, calculation methods that approximate the effect of cash flows are acceptable. Therefore, the GIPS require TWRRs that adjust for daily weighted cash flows for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2005, and require the use of TWRRs with valuations at the time of large

= 1}{W_{i} * CF_{i}} = \\text{sum of each cash flow multiplied by its weights}\n\\]\n\\[\nW_{i} = \\frac{CD - D_{i}}{CD}\n\\]\n\\[\nCD = \\text{number of calendar days over the return period}\n\\]\n\\[\nD_{i} = \\text{day during the return period on which the cash flow occurred}\n\\]\nThe main attraction of the modified Dietz method is that it is not necessary to know the value of a portfolio on every day that a cash flow occurs. The cost of this convenience is that the method does not provide an accurate estimate of the true time-weighted rate of return (TWRR). TWRR estimates under the modified Dietz method are the most inaccurate when a combination of the following conditions exists: 1) one or more large cash flows occur and 2) cash flows occur when markets are highly volatile.\nIt is important to note that beginning January 1, 2010, firms that use approximation methods, such as the modified Dietz method and modified internal rate of return methods, will not be in compliance with the GIPS when the Standards will likely require the use of calculation methods that require valuations at the time of every external cash flow.\nThe main advantage of the daily valuation method  is that it calculates the true TWRR. The major criticism of the method is that it requires precise valuation of the portfolio on each date that a cash flow occurs, which may not be practical for some firms, particularly for those that do not have daily valuation

and cash equivalents\n\nStandard 2.A.3. Returns from cash and cash equivalents held in portfolios must be included in total return calculations.\nCash returns must be included in portfolio total-return calculations as long as the portfolio manager has control over the amount of the portfolio that is allocated to cash. This requirement stands even if the manager does not actually control the investment of the cash, as is the case when excess cash is held in a money market account.\n\n\n\nFees and expenses\nStandard 2.A.4. All returns must be calculated after the deduction of the actual trading expenses incurred during the period.\n\nBecause trading expenses must be paid when implementing an investment strategy, they must be included in return calculations. Direct trading expenses include brokerage commissions, regulatory fees, and duty and/or tax associated with a transaction. Indirect trading expenses include bid/ask spread. Custody fees are not considered direct trading expenses (even if they are charged at a specified rate per transaction), and trading expenses may not be estimated.\n\nStandard 2.A.5. If the actual trading expenses cannot be identified and segregated from a bundled fee:\n\nWhen calculating gross-of-fees returns, returns must be reduced by the entire bundled fee or the portion of the bundled fee that includes the direct trading expenses. The use of estimated trading expenses is not permitted.\nWhen calculating net-of-fees returns, returns must be reduced by the entire bundled fee or the portion of the bundled fee that includes the direct trading expenses and the investment management fee. The use of estimated trading expenses is not permitted.\n“A fee that combines multiple fees into one ‘bundled’ fee. Bundled fees can include any combination of management, transaction, custody, and other administrative fees.”\nExamples given are all-in and wrap fees. Given the nature of bundled fees, it may not be possible to identify direct trading expenses. Because estimated costs may not be deducted (this point is important-it is mentioned twice in the same Standard), the entire bundled fee, or that component of it that is known to contain all the direct expenses, should be deducted instead.\n\nStandard 5.A.1. The following items must be reported for each composite presented:\n\nAt least five years of annual performance (or a record for the period since firm or composite inception if the firm or composite has been in existence less than five year) that meets the requirements of the GIPS standards; after presenting five years of performance, the firm must present additional annual performance up to a minimum of ten years.\nAnnual returns for all years clearly identified as gross- or net-of-fees.\nFor composites with a composite inception date beginning on or after January 1, 2011, when the initial period is less than a full year, firms must present returns from the composite inception through the initial year-end.\nFor composites with a termination date of January 1, 2011, or later, returns from the last annual period through the termination date.\n\n3.A.3. FIRMS MUST NOT LINK performance of simulated or model PORTFOLIOS with actual performance.\n3.A.5. COMPOSITES MUST include new PORTFOLIOS on a timely and consistent basis after each PORTFOLIO comes under management.\n3.A.6. Terminated PORTFOLIOS MUST be included in the historical performance of the COMPOSITE up to the last full measurement period that each PORTFOLIO was under management.\n5.A.4. Returns for periods of less than one year MUST NOT be annualized.\n\nAnnual returns for a benchmark, which reflects the mandate, objective, or strategy of the portfolio.\nThe number of portfolios in the composite at each year-end. If the composite contains five portfolios or less, the number of portfolios is not required.\nThe amount of assets in the composite at the end of each annual period.\nEither total firm assets or composite assets as a percentage of firm assets at each annual period end.\nA measure of dispersion of individual portfolio returns for each annual period. If the composite contains five portfolios or less for the full year, a measure of dispersion is not required.\n\nInternal dispersion is a measure of the range of returns for only those portfolios that are included in the composite over the entire period. Portfolios added to or removed from a composite during the period are not included in that period’s calculation of internal dispersion.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nStandard 5.A.2. For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011, firms must present for each each annual period:\n\nThree-year annualized ex post standard deviation using monthly returns for the composite and benchmark.\nAn additional 3-year ex post risk measure if management feels standard deviation is inappropriate. The firm must match the periodicity of calculated returns used for the composite and benchmark.\n4.A.33. FIRMS MUST disclose if the three-year annualized EX-POST STANDARD DEVIATION of the COMPOSITE and/or BENCHMARK is not presented because 36 monthly returns are not available.\n\nStandard 5.A.3. Firms may link non-GIPS-compliant returns to their compliant history so long as the firms meet the disclosure requirements for noncompliant performance and only compliant returns are presented for periods after January 1, 2000.\n\n4.A.15. For any performance presented for periods prior to 1 January 2000 that does not comply with the GIPS standards, FIRMS MUST disclose the periods of non-compliance.\n\nStandard 5.A.4. Returns of portfolios and composites for periods of less than one year must not be annualized.\n\nThe annualizing of partial-year returns is essentially the simulation of returns over a period, which is not allowed.\n3.A.3. FIRMS MUST NOT LINK performance of simulated or model PORTFOLIOS with actual performance.\n3.A.6. Terminated PORTFOLIOS MUST be included in the historical performance of the COMPOSITE up to the last full measurement period that each PORTFOLIO was under management.\n5.A.1. The following items MUST be presented in each COMPLIANT PRESENATION:\n\nStandard 5.A.5. For periods beginning on or after January 1, 2006, and ending prior to January 1, 2011, if a composite includes carve-outs, the presentation must include the percentage of the composite that is composed of carve-outs for each annual period.\n\n3.A.8. For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010, a CARVE-OUT MUST NOT be included in a COMPOSITE unless the CARVE-OUT is managed separately with its own cash balance.\n\nStandard 5.A.6. If a composite contains any non-fee-paying portfolios, the firm must present, as of the end of each annual period, the percentage of the composite assets represented by the non-fee-paying portfolios.\n\n3.A.1. All actual, fee-paying, discretionary PORTFOLIOS MUST be included in at least one COMPOSITE. Although non-fee-paying discretionary PORTFOLIOS may be included in a COMPOSITE (with appropriate disclosure), non-discretionary PORTFOLIOS MUST NOT be included in a FIRM’S COMPOSITES.\n\nStandard 5.A.7. If a composite includes bundled-fee portfolios, the firm must present, as of the end of each annual period, the percentage of the composite assets represented by bundled-fee portfolios.\nStandard 5.A.8.\n\nGenerally a performance track record of a composite must stay with the firm where it was generated. The record is not “portable,” but if a past firm or affiliation is acquired and if three other conditions are met, the past record must be linked to and used by the new or acquiring firm. The three conditions are:\nSubstantially all the investment decision makers are employed by the new firm (e.g., research department, portfolio managers, and other relevant staff);\nThe decision-making process remains substantially intact and independent within the new firm; and\nthe new firm has records that document and support the reported performance."

Costs or book values are not permitted.\n\nFair value is the price, including any earned income, at which willing and knowledgeable participants would trade. These should be observable prices for identical investment trading in active markets. For thinly traded securities or other assets for which current market prices are not readily available, firms should use recognized and justifiable methods for estimating fair value.\n0.A.13. For periods beginning on or after 1 January 2011, TOTAL FIRM ASSET MUST be the aggregate FAIR VALUE of all discretionary and non-discretionary assets managed by the FIRM. This includes both fee-paying and non-fee-paying PORTFOLIOS.\n\nStandard 1.A.3. Portfolio valuation.\n\nPrior to January 1, 2001, portfolios must be value at least quarterly.\nBeginning on or after January 1, 2001, at least monthly.\nbeginning on or after January 1, 2010, at least monthly and on the date of all large external cash flows.\n2.A.2. FIRMS MUST calculate TIME-WEIGHTED RATES OF RETURN that adjust for EXTERNAL CASH FLOWS. Both periodic and sub-period returns MUST be geometrically LINKED. EXTERNAL CASH FLOWS MUST be treated according the to FIRM’S COMPOSITE-specific policy. At a minimum:\n\nFor periods beginning on or after 1 January 2001, FIRMS MUST calculate PORTFOLIO returns at least monthly.\nFor periods beginning on or after 1 January 2005, FIRMS MUST calculate PORTOFLIO returns that adjust for daily-weighted EXTERNAL CASH FLOW.\n\n\nStandard 1.A.4. For periods beginning January 1, 2010, firms must value portfolios as of the calendar month-end or the last business day of the month.\nStandard 1.A.5. For periods beginning January 1, 2005, firms must use trade-date accounting.\nStandard 1.A.7. For periods beginning January 1, 2006, composites must have consistent beginning and ending annual valuation dates. unless the composite is reported on a non-calendar fiscal year, the beginning and ending valuation dates must be at calendar year-end (or on the last business day of the year)."

Firms must meet all requirements on a firm-wide basis in order to claim compliance.\nOnly investment management firms may claim compliance; individuals may not claim GIPS compliance.\nThe GIPS provide a minimum standard where local or country-specific laws, regulation, or industry standards may not exist.\nThe GIPS require managers to include all actual fee-paying, discretionary portfolios in composites defined according to similar strategy and/or investment objective.\nFirms must present a minimum of five years of GIPS-compliant history or since inception if less than five years. After presenting at least five years of compliant history, the firm must add annual performance each year going forward, up to ten years, at a minimum.\nFirms may link years of noncompliant performance but must present only compliant data for periods beginning on after January 1, 2000.\nIf an investment firm applies the GIPS in a performance situation that is not addressed specifically by the standards or that is open to interpretation, disclosures other than those required by the GIPS may be necessary. To fully explain the performance included in a presentation, firms are encouraged to present all relevant supplemental information.\nIn cases in which applicable local or country-specific laws or regulations conflict with the GIPS, the standards require firms to comply with the local law or regulation and make full disclosure of the conflict.\nJanuary 1, 2011, is the effective date of the 2010 edition of the GIPS. Presentations that include performance for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2011, must comply with the 2010 version of the GIPS.\n\n\n\nBenefits to Managers and clients\nThe ability to compare the performance of firms operating in different countries with different sets of established practices.\nIn addition to a more reliable measure of past investment performance results, the GIPS provide managers with the ability to compete fairly in foreign markets."

If (according to the firm’s definition of discretion) a portfolio is deemed discretionary, it is considered sufficiently free of client-mandated constraints such that the manager is able to pursue its stated strategy, objectives, or mandate. The GIPS require that all actual, fee-paying discretionary portfolios are included in at least one composite.\nTotal asset excludes leverages, advisory-only, uncalled and un-committed capital.\n\nDefinition of the firm\nA firm is defined as:\n\nAn investment firm, subsidiary, or division held out to clients or potential clients as a distinct business entity.\n\nA distinct business entity is defined as:\n\na unit, division, department, or office that is organizationally or functionally separated from other units, divisions, departments, or offices and that retains discretion over the assets it manages and that should have autonomy over the investment decision-making process."

    "text": "Monetary policy\nCentral banks often use monetary policy as a countercyclical force, attempting to optimize the economy’s performance. Most central banks strive to balance price stability against economic growth. The ultimate goal is to keep growth near its long-run sustainable rate, because growth faster than the long-run rate usually results in increased inflation.\nTo spur growth, a central bank can take actions to reduce short-term interest rates. This results in greater consumer spending, greater business spending, higher stock prices, and higher bond prices. Lower interest rates also usually result in a lower value of the domestic currency, which is thought to increase exports. In addition to the direction of change, the level of interest rates is important. The equilibrium interest rate in a country (the rate at which a balance between growth and inflation is achieved) is referred to as the neutral rate. It is generally thought that the neutral rate is composed of an inflation component, a real growth component, and judgment from policy makers.\ndata:image/svg+xml;supportsDarkMode=1;base64,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

    "text": "Negative interest rates\nNegative interest rates were generally considered a hypothetical curiosity before the 2007-2009 financial crisis. A negative rate is defined as a net payment made to keep money on deposit at a financial institution or payment of a net fee to invest in short-term instruments.\nZero was regarded as the sustainable lower rate of interest because investors could hold physical cash instead (earning no interest). As investors withdrew funds from banks to hold cash, bank balance sheets would shrink as they paid out funds and stopped making loans. Simply supply and demand analysis should dictate that with a smaller supply of funds available to lend, the price paid (interest rate) to borrow increases.\nThe flaw in this analysis was that negative interest rates did not cause the expected large move into physical cash. The daily exchange of funds in modern economies is too large. The implicit advantages of being able to quickly transfer large amounts of money held on deposit to settle transactions outweighed the explicit cost of holding those deposits at negative rates. Without the exit of funds from the banking system, it turned out that negative interest rates were sustainable for extended periods.\nAs mentioned earlier, the slowdown in economic activity during the crisis and already very low interest rates led some central banks to experiment with less-tested monetary policy-QE approach. QE led to larger injections of funds by central banks into the commercial banking system with the announced intent that these injections were long term in nature. The hope was this would stimulate bank lending and increase economic activity.\nNegative interest rates should, in theory, have similar effects. Holders of funds would find it more desirable to spend the money, stimulating economic activity; or, they would invest in longer-term stocks and bonds, driving up prices and creating a wealth effect. Or, negative rates would lead consumers and businesses to borrow at zero or native rates to spend now.\nNegative interest rates complicate the process of forming capital market expectations:\n\nThe risk-free rate is the starting point for buildup models used to estimate long-run returns for asset classes. When the risk-free rate is negative, a sustainable expected risk-free rate, such as the policy neutral rate in the Taylor rule, is more appropriate as that starting point. That rate is generally not regarded as fully risk free, so a modest default premium can be removed.\nForming capital market expectation over shorter time horizon is further complicated by a need to forecast the time path over which negative rates will converge to a long-run sustainable risk-free rate. Multiple path projections should be considered to allow for uncertainty regarding how the convergence will occur.\nAnother approach to shorter-term projections of asset class returns is to interpret negative risk-free rates as being consistent with contraction or early recovery stages of the business cycle.\nUsing historical data as a starting point for forecasting is more problematic because few comparable periods exist, and the negative rates suggest significant structural economic changes are occurring. This kind of regime change makes statistics based on historical data less reliable."

The current account largely consists of a country’s net exports while the capital account reflects net investment flows. The two accounts are opposites of each other in that a surplus in one account will produce a deficit in the other.\nInterest rates and currency exchange rates can also create linkages. A strong link is created when a smaller economy “pegs” its currency to that of a larger and more developed economy. The peg is a unilateral declaration by the pegging country to maintain the exchange rate.

the interest rates of the pegged currency will exceed the interest rates of the currency to which it is linked, and the interest rate differential will fluctuate with the market’s confidence in the peg. If confidence is high, the rate differential can be small. If there is doubt the peg will be maintained, investors will require a larger interest rate differential as compensation for the risk of holding the pegged currency. A common problem arises if investors begin to lose confidence in the pegged currency and it begins to decline in value. The pegging country must then increase short-term interest rates to attract capital and maintain the value of the currency at the peg.\nIn the absence of pegging, the relationship of interest rate differentials and currency movement can reflect several factors:\n\nIf a currency is sustainability overvalued and expected to decline, bond interest rates are likely to be higher to compensate foreign investors for the expected decline in the currency value.\nRelative bond yields, both nominal and real, increase with strong economic activity and increasing demand for funds.\nSavings and investment decisions as well as capital productivity drive the level of real rates. Although real rates may differ across countries, there is a tendency for them to move up and down together given that global savings and investing are linked through the current account."

    "text": "Formal tools\nStatistical methods involve sample statistics, shrinkage estimation (instinct mixed), and time series estimation. Sample statistics use well-known data, including means, variance, and correlation, to forecast future data. This is the clearest approach in forecasting, but it can be imprecise. Alternatively, a shrinkage estimate can be applied to the historical estimate if the analyst believes simple historical results do not fully reflect expected future conditions. A time series estimate forecasts a variable using lagged values of the same variable and combines it with lagged values of other variables, which allows for incorporating dynamics (volatilities) into the forecasts.\nDiscounted cash flow models express the intrinsic value of an asset as the present value of future cash flows. The advantage of these models is their correct emphasis on the future cash flows of an asset and the ability to back out a required return.\nRisk premium or buildup model. Risk premium approaches can be used for both fixed income and equity. The approach starts with a risk-free interest rate and then adds compensation for priced risks, or risks for which an investor would want to be compensated. Risk premium models include equilibrium models (e.g., the Capital Asset Pricing Model), a factor model, and building blocks."

    "text": "DCF Analysis\nThe DCF analysis of fixed income securities is useful when there are known future cash flows, or when cash flows can be estimated reasonably accurately. The DCF analysis supports the use of yield to maturity (YTM) as an estimate of expected return. For bond portfolios, the YTM is the weighted average of the portfolio bonds’ individual YTMs, which is generally considered a good approximation.\nThe assumption of holding the bond to maturity does not factor in optionality, which may result in cash flows not being received as expected. However, even if all expected cash flow are received, there are several reasons why the bond’s realized return may deviate from the initial YTM. First, an investor may sell the bond prior to maturity, generating a capital gain or loss. Second, rising or falling interest rates may result in not only changing bond prices, but changing reinvestment returns. The overall gain or loss to the investor will depend on the investment horizon. For an investment horizon that is shorter than the Macaulay duration, the capital gain/loss impact will be more dominant than the reinvestment impact, meaning for example that falling (rising) interest rates will result in a higher (lower) realized return. For an investment horizon longer than the Macaulay duration, the reinvestment risk dominates, meaning that falling (rising) interest rates will result in a lower (higher) realized return.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "The risk premium (building block) approach\nThe building block approach starts with a risk-free rate and then adds compensation for additional risk.\nThe short-term default-free rate\nThe short-term default-free rate matches the forecast horizon and is calculated from the most liquid investment. As a result, it is closest to the government zero-coupon yield and is closely tied to the central bank policy rate. When the investment horizon is much longer than the maturity of the short-term instrument, alternative approaches may be optimal, either by using the yield of a longer maturity zero-coupon bond, or taking the return that could be realized by rolling over the short-term instrument over the investment horizon. Futures contract rates provide useful proxies for this expected path of short-term interest rates.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nTerm premium\nWhile the rates implied from the spot yield curve gives us useful information about the term premium, the real term premium cannot be derived from the yield curve alone. Empirical evidence suggests that the term premiums are positive and are related to duration. There are four primary drivers of the term premium\n\ninflation uncertainty - Higher inflation levels typically correspond to higher inflation uncertainty, causing nominal yields to rise and the term premium to increase.\nrecession hedge - When inflation is caused by strong aggregate demand, nominal bond returns are negatively correlated with growth, corresponding to low term premiums. When inflation is caused by aggregate supply, nominal bond returns are positively correlated with growth, corresponding to higher term premiums.\nsupply and demand - The relative supply of short- and long-term default-free bonds determines the slope of the yield curve, which influences the level of term premiums.\nbusiness cycles\nother indicators\n\nex ante (forecast) real yield\nCochrane and Piazzesi curve factor\nKim and Wright premium\nSlope of the yield curve\nSupply indicator\nCyclical proxies\n\n\nCredit premium\nThe credit premium compensate for the expected level of losses and for the risk of default losses, both of which are components of the credit spread.\nEmpirical evidence suggests that while average yield spreads include a small return premium, the premiums earned tend to be uneven and are subject to significant clustering of persistent high and low default rates. (default rate이 credit premium에 완전히 잘 반영되어 있지는 않다) As a result, the yield spread is typically not considered a good predictor of future default rates. The financial market variables with the strongest predictive power of the credit spread are stock returns, stock volatility, and the risk-free rate, while GDP growth and default rate changes do not have strong predictive capabilities.\nBonds with very high credit quality (AAA and AA) have extremely low default rates, and their credit premium and spreads are mainly driven by downgrade bias-this is an asymmetrical risk indicating that a downgrade is more likely than a credit improvement or an upgrade. The credit premium and spreads of low(er) rated bonds, especially non-investment grade bonds, reflect much higher compensation for credit risk.\nCredit premiums are not positively related to maturity. In fact, credit premiums tend to be higher at shorter maturities, possibly due to event risk (defaults are large credit negative events, but a bond will not pay more than its face value), and illiquidity (bonds with a short time left to maturity tend to be illiquid older bonds that are not actively traded). To take advantage of these credit features, portfolio managers often use a barbell strategy, in which they take on credit risk from shorter maturity bonds and take duration risk from long maturities.\nLiquidity premium\nLiquidity tends to be the highest at the earliest stages of a bond’s like, typically during the first few weeks only. As a general rule, liquidity is higher for bonds that are 1) issued at close to par or market rates, 2) new, 3) large in size, 4) issued by a frequent and well-known issuer, 5) simple in structure, and 6) of high credit quality."

Many emerging countries are dependent on foreign borrowing, which can later create crisis situations in their economy, currency, and financial markets.\nMany emerging countries also have unstable political and social systems. their undiversified nature makes them susceptible to volatile capital flows and economic crises.\nSigns that an emerging market is more susceptible to risk include:\n\nwealth concentration\nincome concentration and less diverse tax base\ngreater dominance of cyclical industries, including commodities and less pricing power\nrestrictions on capital flows and trade; currency restrictions\npoor workforce education and infrastructure and weak technological advancement\ninadequate fiscal and monetary policies\nlarge amounts of foreign borrowing in foreign currencies\nless developed and smaller financial markets\nexposure to volatile capital flows\n\nSeveral guidelines that look at the health of an emerging market. Potential bond investors should look at these factors before committing to invest funds in these markets:\n\nto gauge fiscal policy, most analysts examine the deficit-to-GDP ratio. Ratios greater than 4% indicate substantial credit risk. The debt-to-GDP ratio of 70% to 80% has been troublesome for emerging countries.\n\nFiscal deficit to GDP < 4%\n\nTo compensate for the higher risk in these countries, investors should expect a real growth rate of at least 4%.\nA current account deficit exceeding 4% of GDP has been a warning sign of potential difficulty.\n\nCurrent account deficit to GDP < 4%\n\nForeign debt levels greater than 50% of GDP indicate that the country may be overleveraged. Debt levels greater than 200% of the current account receipts also indicate high risk.\n\nDebt to GDP < 70%\n\nForeign exchange reserves less than 100% of short-term debt is a sign of trouble (greater than 200% is considered strong).\n\nForeign reserve to short-term debt < 100%\n\n\nThe government’s stance regarding structural reforms and property rights is important. If the government is supportive of structural reforms necessary for growth, then the investment environment is more hospitable. When the government is committed to responsible fiscal policies, competition, and the privatization of state-owned businesses, there are better prospects for growth. Weak enforcement laws, property rights laws, nationalization of property, and corruption are hazard signs. Coalition governments are also seen as riskier because of the inherent political, and therefore policy, instability."

    "text": "Discounted cash flow approach\nDCF models\nThe advantage of these models is their correct emphasis on the future cash flows of an asset and the ability to back out a required return. The models are most suitable for long-term valuation.\nApplied to equity markets, the most common application of DCF models is the Gordon growth model, or constant growth model. It is most commonly used to back out the expected return on equity and is often applied to entire markets. In this case, the growth rate is proxied by the nominal growth in GDP, which is the sum of the real growth rate in GDP plus the rate of inflation.\nGrinold and Kroner (2002) take this model one step further by including a variable that adjusts for stock repurchases-which companies use to transfer cash to shareholders-and changes in market valuations as represented by changes in the price-earnings (P/E) ratio. The Grinold-Kroner model states that the expected return of a stock is its dividend yield, plus the inflation rate, plus the real earnings growth rate, minus the change in stock outstanding, plus changes in the P/E ratio:\n\\[\nE(R_{e}) \\approx D/P + (\\%\\Delta{E} - \\$\\Delta{S}) + \\%\\Delta{P/E}\n\\]\nThe variables of the Grinold-Kroner model can be regrouped into three components: the expected income return, the expected nominal growth in earnings, and the expected repricing return.\n\nExpected cash flow return (income return)\n\\[\nD/P - \\%\\Delta{S} = \\text{income return} = \\text{current yield}\n\\]\n\n\nExpected nominal earnings growth\n\\[\n\\text{expected nominal earnings growth} = \\%\\Delta{E}\n\\]\n\n\nExpected repricing return\n\\[\n\\text{expected repricing return} = \\%\\Delta{P/E}\n\\]\nexpected nominal earnings growth and expected repricing return are capital gain yields.\nIt is important to understand that the assumptions of the Grinold-Kroner model may lead to irrational results. Because the model assumes an infinite time horizon, it ignores an investor’s time horizon. However, by selecting any positive growth rate for the P/E ratio, the model would assume an infinitely rising P/E ratio, an implausible result. For very long-term time horizons, the theoretically appropriate %P/E = 0 (and also %S = 0)."

The Singer-Terhaar model is based on two versions of the international Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM): one in which global asset markets are fully integrated, and another in which markets are fully segmented. The model then looks at the expectations of actual segmentation/integration and takes a weighted average of the two assumptions to calculate returns. The Singer-Terhaar approach begins with the CAPM:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThink of the global investable market as consisting of all investable assets, traditional and alternative.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThis expression states that the risk premium for an asset is equal to the product of its correlation with the global market portfolio and the standard deviation of the asset, multiplied by the Sharpe ratio for the global portfolio (in parentheses). From this formula, we forecast the risk premium and expected return for a market.\nThe Singer-Terhaar model then adjusts the CAPM for market imperfections, such as segmentation. Government restrictions on investing are a frequent cause of market segmentation. If markets are segmented, two assets with the same risk can have different expected returns because capital cannot flow to the higher return asset. The presence of investment barriers increases the risk premium for securities in segmented markets.\nIn reality, most markets are neither fully segmented nor fully integrated. Developed world equity markets have been estimated as 75% to 90% integrated, whereas emerging market equities have been estimated as 50% to 75% integrated. In the example that follows, we will adjust for partial market segmentation by estimating an equity risk premium assuming full integration and an equity risk premium assuming full segmentation, and then taking a weighted average of the two. Under the full segmentation assumption, the relevant global portfolio is the individual asset as its own market portfolio, meaning that the asset is perfectly correlated with itself.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nIf no local market Sharpe ratio is given, then use the global market Sharpe ratio."

The cap rate is similar to the denominator of the Gordon Growth model, looking at expected return less the NOI growth rate. When an infinite time period is assumed, the cap rate can be calculated as:\n\\[\nE(R_{re}) = \\text{cap rate} + \\text{NOI growth rate}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{cap rate} = E(R_{re}) - \\text{NOI growth rate}\n\\]\nDuring stable periods, the long-run NOI growth rate should be close to GDP growth. If an investor has a finite time period, the formula changes by subtracting from expected return the change in the cap rate:\nThe cap rate is quite sensitive to competitive pressures. With the rapid growth of online retailers, the difference in the cap rates of malls in the United States with high and low productivity grew from 1.2% in 2008 to 3.2% in 2018.\nSimilar to the expected return net of growth rate for equities, the cap rate is used as a long-term measure of risk discount rate for real estate property valuations. Hence, cap rates are positively related to changes in interest rates and vacancy rates. Credit spreads, which are countercyclical, mitigate the cyclical sensitivity of cap rates."

Overall, the combined risk premium is higher than of corporate bonds but lower than equities.\nLiquidity risk is also important for real estate. For publicly traded real estate, including REITs, the liquidity risk is the risk that the asset cannot be sold quickly at a reasonable price. For real estate as an asset group, liquidity risk reflects an inability to sell the asset expect at periodic times.\nOnce the appropriate risk premiums are calculated, real estate can be used in equilibrium models including Singer-Terhaar. However, analysts must make two adjustments: the impact of smoothing must be removed from the data, and the analyst should adjust for illiquidity by incorporating a liquidity premium. The local, rather than global, nature of real estate should also be considered."

When adjusted for leverage, REITs as an asset class historically show higher returns and lower volatility than direct real estate. This difference may be due to investors capturing much of the liquidity risk premium of direct investments, while also profiting from professional management."

    "text": "Untitled\n\n\nThe primary focus is on the way in which derivative contracts (instruments whose values derive from the economic performance of underlying securities, currencies, or other instruments or factors) may be used to hedge, or change the degree of exposure to, existing positions (for example a holding of a stock, or the exposure to a foreign currency caused by the ownership of an asset or liability in that currency).\nReading 8 deals with options, mainly focused on options on individual stocks, although the principles apply equally well to options on any other instruments.\nThe sequence of topics in our coverage of Reading 8 differs from the LOS order. We start by looking at the payoffs and profits associated with holding option positions to expiration.\ntake a position in something = invest\n\nlong - profit when something up\nshort - profit when something down\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\ngoals of derivatives\n\nhedge\nchange the degree of exposure\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nIn particular, distinguishing between option value and profit (respectively pre- and post-initial premium), and the graphical representation of how they vary with differing values of the underlying price, is very helpful when we move on to analyze more complex strategies.\nEach option contract will specify the underlying to which the right relates:\n\nUnderlying include stocks and stock indices, bonds and bond futures, currencies, commodities, and more abstract factors such as stock volatility.\n\n\n\nThe key determinants of an option’s value are:\n\nthe strike price\nthe current level of the underlying\nthe remaining time to expiration\nthe volatility of the underlying (the expected annualized standard deviation of the underlying over the period to option expiration)\n\nMarket participants may not agree on what an option is worth-most likely because they disagree on the appropriate figure to use for volatility. However, note that all options that trade on exchanges will have a value, which is reflective of the consensus at that point in time. The current value of an option can be used to infer the consensus estimate of volatility for the underlying, known as implied volatility. This is done by working backwards through a pricing model, given the other factors can be directly observed.\nNote that implied volatility is not the same as historical (realized) volatility, which is the square root of the actual realized variance of returns to date.\nIt is important to note that the volatility that is used to determine the option value is an estimate of the volatility looking forward, which is not the same as actual movement in the stock price.\nNote that the intrinsic value is not the same as the profit to the long, which would have to factor in the premium that the long originally paid for the option. This means that it is perfectly possible for an option to be ITM, but for exercise to result in a loss to the long (if the intrinsic value < initial premium paid).\nAt any point before expiration an option also has time value, which reflects what might happen over its remaining life.\nA couple of general principles are worth remembering, namely that with all other factors held constant:\n\nhigher volatility means higher option premiums (both for calls and puts)\nless time to expiry means lower option premiums (both for calls and puts)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThis means that if we know the shape of the value line for a strategy, the profit line will have exactly the same shape.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nIt is clear that the maximum loss from a long call occurs when the option expires OTM with zero value, thus equals the premium paid.\nA long call has no maximum profit-the higher the stock price at expiry, the higher the profit on the call, with no upper limit.\nThis means that equivalent long and short positions will have identical breakeven values for the underlying, while their maximum losses and profits will just swap around.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe basic motivation for buying a call is to profit from a rise in the underlying price, while limiting the downside.\nWhen a call is sold (without any hedging position in place) then the position is described as a naked (uncovered) call, and limited upside from falls in the underlying price is balanced against unlimited potential losses from the underlying rising.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe basic motivation for buying a put is to profit from a fall in the underlying price, while limiting the downside.\nWhen a put is sold limited upside from rises in the underlying price is balanced against large (although limited) potential losses from the underlying falling.\nWriting a put option and simultaneously depositing the exercise price into a designated account is called writing a cash-secured put, thereby the long is assured that the put writer would be able to purchase the stock, if called on to do so. Simply writing a put without doing this is called a naked put."

    "text": "Covered calls with extra yield the main focus\nSuppose an investor has a long position in XYZ stock on 20 March. They think that the stock has limited upside over the next month, and are prepared to sell off upside above $55 ($2.86 above the 20 March stock price of $52.14).\nThe classic way of doing this is to sell a call (a covered call, because the risk of the short option position is hedged by ownership of the stock), in this case an XYZ APR 55 call. This will (immediately) give premium income of $2.52 (per share) in March. → immediately\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nAt $55 the stock has risen by $2.86, and this is thus the maximum gain (ignoring the call premium). Note also that, ignoring the call premium, the breakeven point is the original stock price of $52.14.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe maximum profit equals $2.86 + $2.52 = $5.38, while the breakeven is $2.52 lower than it was without the premium received, which is at $52.14 - $2.52 = $49.62 (up to a $2.52 fall in the stock price is cushioned by the call premium).\nNotice that the profit line has the same general shape as a short put and, as for a short put, the maximum loss is the same as the breakeven (since the loss increases one-for-one below breakeven, but the stock price cannot fall below zero). Thus maximum loss $49.62.\nSince the investor holding the stock believed the stock had limited upside over the month, they have turned upside potential (which they did not need) into cash in hand. They will only end up worse off if the stock price at expiry exceeds $55 + $2.52 = $57.52, which is the level at which the original stock gain/loss line cuts through the net profit line.\nIn general, for a covered call:\n\\[\n\\text{maximum profit at expiry} = X - S_{0} + c_{0}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{breakeven stock price at expiry} = \\text{maximum loss at expiry} = S_{0} - c_{0}\n\\]\nThe motivation in the previous example of a covered call was earning extra yield (the focus was on the premium income). - short OTM call\n\nReducing a position at a favorable price\nShort ITM call\nA second scenario where covered calls might be written is when an investor holds a position in a stock and intends to reduce the holding in the near future. She might simply sell 1500 shares at $52.14, realizing $78210, but instead could write 15 exchange-traded XYZ April 50 call contracts (on 1500 shares), receiving a total premium of 1500 * $4.80 = $7200. Note that the options are currently ITM.\nProvided the share price at the April expiry is no lower than $50, the options will get exercised, and Jenkins will be obliged to deliver 1500 shares for 1500 * $50 = $75000. Adding the premium already received to this brings the total proceeds to $75000 + $7200 = $82200, which exceeds the proceeds had she simply sold at the market price on 20 March.\nHowever, there is a risk: if the XYZ price at expiration is lower than $50 then the calls with not be exercised and the shares will not be sold-the opportunity to sell at the current favorable price will have been missed.\nIf the strategy does work as intended, however, Jenkins will have captured the time value embedded in the option price (in this case $4.80 - ($52.14 - $50) = $2.66 per share, which corresponds to 1500 * $2.66 = $3990 (= $82200 - $78210).\n\n\nTarget price realization\nshort slightly OTM call\nA third motivation is realizing a target price. In this case calls are written with a strike just above the current market price. The idea is that the investor believes the shock should be worth a bit more than its current price, and would be happy to sell it at the slightly-higher price. For example Perkins holds XYZ shares at $52.14 and writes APR 52.5 calls, receiving $3.53 per share. If the calls are exercised in April, then the shares are sold at $52.5 strike price, so a total per share of $52.5 + $3.53 = $56.03 has been realized.\nThe dangers are twofold. First, the stock price may rise substantially, in which case Perkins would regret having to sell at $52.5, rather than the higher market price. Second, the stock price might decline, the opportunity to sell at the current level will have been missed.\nThe observable difference between these three uses of covered calls is the value of the strike relative to the current stock price:\n\nFor yield enhancement, the calls are OTM (possibly substantially so).\nFor reducing a position at a favorable price, the calls are ITM.\nFor target price realization, the calls are marginally OTM."

In this case there will be no net inflow or outflow at initiation and the investor will have constructed a zero-cost collar.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nNotice, in this case, that the line for stock profit + option values is the same as the net profit line because of the zero net initial premium."

This is also the maximum value, since any further upside to the long call is hedged away by the short call, which goes ITM above 55.\nThe maximum loss (when value = 0) is the net premium paid, $2.20.\nBreakeven occurs when the value of the long call exactly compensates for the net premium paid. This will be $2.20 above the lower strike, at $50 + $2.20 = $52.20.\nThe maximum profit is the maximum value of $5 less the net premium, thus $5 - $2.20 = $2.80.\nIn general, for a bull call spread:\n\nMaximum loss = net premium paid\nBreakeven = lower strike + net premium paid\nMaximum profit = difference between strikes - net premium paid\n\nThe bull call spread is an example of a debit spread since it entails a net outlay: the bought call, with a lower strike, is more valuable then the sold call.\nThe other debit spread is the bear put spread.\n\n\nBear put spread\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nIt is clear that the exposure is bearish, but limited, compared to just having a long put at 55.\nFor a bear put spread:\n\nmaximum loss = net premium paid ($2.74 in this case)\nBreakeven = higher strike - net premium paid ($55 - $2.74 = $52.26)\nMaximum profit = difference between strikes - net premium paid ($5 - $2.74 = $2.26)\n\n\n\nBear call and bull put spreads\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nIt is also possible, of course, to use calls to create a bear spread, or puts to create a bull spread. In both cases there would be a net inflow of premium (since the relatively more valuable option is sold) and they are referred to as credit spreads.\nAs a general rule, assume that a bull spread would be constructed using calls and that a bear spread would be constructed using puts (i.e. that debit spreads are to be preferred over credit spreads) unless a question states otherwise.\nFor example, a bear call spread could use a short XYZ June 50 call ($7.40) plus a long XYZ June 55 call ($5.20) with a net initial inflow of $7.40 - $5.20 = $2.20.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum profit} = \\text{net premium received}\n\\]\n\\[\nBreakeven = \\text{lower strike} + \\text{net premium received}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum loss} = \\text{difference between strikes} - \\text{net premium received}\n\\]\nSimilarly, a bull put spread is the reverse of a bear put spread, in this case a short XYZ May 55 put ($6.61) and a long XYZ May 50 put ($3.87).\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum profit} = \\text{net premium received}\n\\]\n\\[\nBreakeven = \\text{higher strike} - \\text{net premium received}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Maximum loss} = \\text{difference between strikes} - \\text{net premium received}\n\\]"

What is important is an appreciation of the meaning and significant of each one.\nTaking the XYZ stock options as an example, below is the table of option premiums on 20 March (when the stock price was $52.14) as seen before, together with a table of delta at the same point in time:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFor example, the MAY 55 call ahs a delta of 0.47, meaning that if the stock price rose by $1 to $53.14 then the MAY 55 call would rise, in principle, by $0.47, to $4.02 + $0.47 = $4.49. Note that all other factors are assumed held constant, in particular, time, so the change has to be instantaneous.\nIn fact, if we recompute the MAY 55 call premium for the $53.14 stock price, the pricing model gives us a figure of $4.51, slightly higher than the $4.49 predicted by delta. This is because the option price line is not a straight line (other than at expiration), with a curvature measured by gamma, so delta itself varies with the underlying.\nThe vertical distance between the (total) value line and the intrinsic value line corresponds to the time value, which is at its greatest around ATM, and diminishes the more the potion is ITM or OTM.\nTime value is a reflection of the relative difficulty of hedging an option, and options are harder to hedge when it is unclear whether they are going to expire ATM, ITM or OTM. If they are already deeply ITM or OTM there is less uncertainty about this.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nFor example, the MAY 55 call has a gamma of 0.031, meaning if the share price were $1 higher, the call’s delta would be 0.031 higher: 0.470 + 0.031 = 0.501.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nPuts (long) have negative delta, since the line slopes downwards, but there is a simple rule that applies to both calls and puts regarding the absolute size of delta (i.e., ignoring the sign):\nAll other factors held constant:\n\nThe more ITM is an option, the higher is its (absolute) delta (closer to 1)\nThe more OTM is an option, the lower is its (absolute) delta (closer to 0)\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nGamma is trickier to generalize, but it tends to be higher the closer to ATM an option, and it at its greatest for ATM options that are close to expiration.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

Calendar spreads are the only examples we consider of option strategies where the options have different expirations.\nThe basic motivation with calendar spreads is to exploit the difference in theta between close-to-expiry and more-distant-from-expiry options.\nA long calendar spread entails buying longer-dated options and selling short-dated options with the same strike and underlying. In principle the premium on the shorter-dated should fall faster then the premium on the longer-dated. Thus more value is gained on the short position than is lost on the long position, and a net profit is realized.\nThe options need to be close to ATM so the thetas are the right way around, and little movement should be anticipated in the underlying over the period to expiry of the nearer-dated option (large movement might undermine the profit from the strategy). Both options will either be calls or puts, and the choice between calls and puts will reflect the investor’s view on the longer-term prospects for the stock (calls if bullish, puts if bearish).\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nA short calendar spread (reserve calendar spread) entails selling longer-dated options and buying shorter-dated options with the same strike and underlying. When options are sufficiently ITM or OTM the theta are relatively higher for the longer-dated options, so this time the belief is that the longer-dated options will lose time value relatively more rapidly, thus the position as a whole should gain.\nThe short calendar spread strategy is vulnerable, however, to the underlying moving so the options end up ATM when the shorter-dated option expires (so the longer-dated option premiums rise, unless implied volatility also falls, and overall there is a loss since we are short). If the stock moves at all during the period of the strategy, it would be better for it to move a lot.\n\ntime value 라인을 따라가야 함\n\nIn both cases (long/short calendar spread), the strategy is fundamentally the same: to sell the options that are expected to fall relatively faster as time passes.\nIn general:\n\nA long calendar spread will benefit from a stable market or an increase in implied volatility.\nA short calendar spread will benefit from a stable market or an decrease in implied volatility."

Treasury futures prices will tend to correlate most closely with the CTD bond because the CTD has the lowest basis of any deliverable bond.

With the variance swap, payoffs are increasing at an increasing rate when volatility rises and decreasing at a decreasing rate when volatility falls.\nConvexity is an attractive feature to those who use variance swaps to hedge tail risk. When equity values fall sharply and volatility increases dramatically, decreases in portfolio value are offset by profits on a variance swap that increase at an accelerating rate."

Opinions range from doing nothing to active management:\n\nArguments made for not hedging currency risk include:\n\nIt is best to avoid the time and cost of hedging or trading currencies.\nIn the long-run, unhedged currency effects are a “zero-sum game”; if one currency appreciates, another must depreciate.\nIn the long-run, currencies revert to a theoretical fair value.\n\nThe argument for active management of currency risk is that, in the short run, currency movement can be extreme, and inefficient pricing of currencies can be exploited to add to portfolio return.\n\nCurrency management strategies for portfolio with exchange rate risk range from a passive approach of matching benchmark currency exposures to an active strategy that treats currency exposure independently of benchmark exposures and seeks to profit from (rather than hedge the risk of) currency exposures.\n\nPassive hedging is rule based and typically matches the portfolio’s currency exposure to that of the benchmark used to evaluate the portfolio’s performance.\nDiscretionary hedging allows the manager to deviate modestly from passively hedging by a specified percentage.\nActive currency management allows a manager to have greater deviations from benchmark currency exposures. The goal is to create incremental return (alpha), not to reduce risk.\nA currency overlay is a broad term covering the outsourcing of currency management. At the extreme, the overlay manager will treat currency as an asset class and may take positions independent of other portfolio assets. The manager is purely seeking currency alpha (incremental return), not risk reduction.\n\nThe IPS\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\nStrategic diversification issues\n\nIn the longer run, currency volatility has been lower than in the shorter run, reducing the need to hedge currency in portfolios with a long-term perspective.\nPositive correlation between returns of the asset measured in the foreign currency (\\(R_{FC}\\)) and returns from the foreign asset (\\(R_{FX}\\)) increase volatility of return to the investor (\\(R_{DC}\\)) and increase the need for currency hedging. Negative correlation dampens return volatility and decreases the need to hedge.\nCorrelation tends to vary by time period, providing diversification in some periods and not in others, suggesting a varying hedge ratio is appropriate.\nSome investors assert that there is higher positive correlation between asset and currency returns in bond portfolios than in equity portfolios. If that is true, then there is more reason to hedge currency risk in bond portfolios than in equity portfolios.\nThe hedge ratio (the percentage of currency exposure to hedge) varies by manager preference.\n\n\n\nStrategic cost issues\nHedging is not free and benefits must be weighted versus costs.\n\nopportunity cost\nbid/ask spread\nThe bid/asked transaction cost on a single currency trade is generally small, but repeated transaction costs add up. Full hedging and frequent rebalancing can be costly.\nPurchasing options to hedge involves an upfront option premium cost.\nForward currency contracts are often shorter term than the hedging period, requiring contracts be rolled over as they mature (an FX swap). The hedge lowers return volatility but the rollover can create cash flow volatility with realized gains and losses on the maturing contracts. Financing cash outflows when interest rates are high can be costly as the interest that would have been earned on the funds is lost.\n\ncash flow volatility up\n\nOne hundred percent hedging has an opportunity cost with no possibility of favorable currency movement."

    "text": "The carry trade\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nA carry trade refers to borrowing in a lower interest rate currency and investing the proceeds in a higher interest rate currency. Three issues are important to understand the carry trade.\n\nCovered interest rate parity (CIRP, 이자율 평형이론) holds by arbitrage and establishes that the difference between spot (\\(S_{0}\\)) and forward (\\(F_{0}\\)) exchange rates equals the difference in the periodic interest rates of the two currencies.\n\nThe currency with the higher interest rate should trade at a forward discount, \\(F_{0} < S_{0}\\)\nThe currency with the lower interest rate should trade at a forward premium, \\(F_{0} > S_{0}\\)\n\nThe carry trade is based on a violation of uncovered interest rate parity (UCIRP). UCIRP is an international parity relationship asserting that the forward exchange rate calculated by CIRP is an unbiased estimate of the spot exchange rate that will exist in the future. If this were true:\n\nThe currency with the higher interest rate will decrease in value by the amount of the initial interest rate differential.\nThe currency with the lower interest rate will increase in value by the amount of the initial interest rate differential.\n\n\nIf these expectations were true, a carry trade would earn a zero return.\n\nBecause the carry trade exploit’s a violation of interest rate parity, it can be referred to as trading the forward rate bias. Historical evidence indicates that:\n\nGenerally, the higher interest rate currency has depreciated less than predicted by interest rate parity or even appreciated and a carry trade has earned a profit.\nHowever, a small percentage of the time, the higher interest rate currency has depreciated substantially more than predicted by interest rate parity and a carry trade has generated large losses.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\nGenerally, the carry trade is implemented by borrowing in the lower interest rate currencies of developed economies (funding currencies) and investing in the higher interest rate currencies of emerging economies (investing currencies). Given that periods of financial stress are associated with increasing exchange rate volatility, traders often exit their carry trade positions when exchange rate volatility increases significantly.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe carry trade is generally profitable under normal market conditions. But it can generate large losses in periods of financial distress and high volatility as investors flee high risk (yield) currencies."

    "text": "Roll yield\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nhedge시 horizon 끝날 시 얻는 예상 수익률\nHedging also exposes the portfolio to roll yield or roll return. Roll yield is a return from the movement of the forward price over time toward the spot price of an asset. It can be thought of as the profit or loss on a forward or futures contract if the spot price is unchanged at contract expiration. Determining whether the roll yield produces a profit or a loss will depend on two factors: 1) whether the currency is trading at a forward premium or discount and 2) whether is it purchased or sold. Roll yield for a contract held to expiration is determined by initial forward minus spot price divided by initial spot price.\nRoll yield will affect the cost/benefit analysis of whether to hedge the currency risk. Positive roll yield will shift the analysis toward hedging and negative roll yield will shift the analysis away from hedging.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nAlso note that the roll yield is not the total return from selling or buying the forward. (not a real return) The underlying spot price can increase or decrease. The forward price will converge to that unknown spot price at expiration of the forward. The total of the return to the forward position will be the change in price of the forward. That change in price of the forward was two components: 1) the unknown-in-advance change in the spot price, and 2) the known-in-advance roll yield.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe CFA text mentions but does not further apply a “similarity” between roll yield and trading the forward rate bias.\n\nThe forward rate bias trade (the carry trade) would buy the ZAR in the spot market to invest in and earn the higher interest rate.\nAn investor who needs exposure to the ZAR would buy the ZAR in the forward market at a discount and earn positive roll yield.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

The higher the proportion of retired lives in the plan, the shorter the investment horizon of the plan, which lowers the risk tolerance of the plan. Plans that are frozen (i.e., closed to new participants) will also have shorter investment horizon due to the lack of new active lives joining the plan."

    "text": "Defined Contribution\n\nMain features / mission\ndefined contribution (DC), in which contributions to plan assets today are defined, but there is no guarantee of ultimate benefits paid to beneficiaries.\nbenefit payments\n\ndepends of the performance of investments\nonce promised contributions have been met, there is no liability for the plan sponsor\n\ncontributions\n\nprimarily by employee (employer may contribute also)\n\ninvestment decision-making\n\nsponsor provides suite of available investment funds\nemployee decides level of investment and asset allocation\n\ninvestment risk\n\nfaced by beneficiary\n\nmortality / longevity risk\n\nemployee faces the longevity risk of outliving their own savings\n\nOver recent decades, there has been a move from DB to DC plans driven by the plan sponsors’ preference for lower financial risk and the fact that DC plans are portable.\n\n\nStakeholders\n\nPlan sponsors (employers), while not facing the investment risk or longevity risk of the asset, retain important fiduciary responsibilities. These include contributing to the plan, overseeing the investment of plan assets, and offering suitable investment options to plan participants.\nPlan beneficiaries (employees and retirees) face the investment risk of contributions and investment returns not meeting retirement needs. They also face the longevity risk of living longer than expected and outliving their savings.\nThe board must communicate with participants to keep them well informed, and these communications must consider the participants’ level of sophistication.\nGovernments\n\n\n\nLiabilities and investment horizon\nThe liabilities of a DC plan sponsor are the required contributions to plan assets; hence, unlike under a DB scheme, there is no liability associated with future benefits.\nIndividuals in a DC plan have an investment horizon linked to their age-older participants will have a shorter investment horizon because they will be retiring and drawing benefits sooner. Many DC plans offer a default life-cycle option (also called target date option) where asset mix is managed according to a desired retirement date. These life-cycle options can be either participants-switching options, which automatically switch members to a more conservative asset allocation as they age, or a participant / cohort option, which involves pooling the participants with other investors with a similar retirement date and the funding being managed more conservatively as the retirement date is approached.\n\n\nLiquidity needs\nThe primary drivers of liquidity needs are the age of the workforce and ability of participants to switch or withdraw from the plan.\n\n\nExternal constraints\nAs per DB scheme, regulations vary by country. There is a requirement that plan sponsors educate participants on saving for retirement, particularly with regard to default options for disengaged participants.\nFrom a tax perspective, DC plans in the United States (referred to as 401(k) plans) are tax deferred. This means participants make pretax contributions and investment earnings are not taxable; however, benefits are taxed as ordinary income.\n\n\nInvestment objectives\nThe main objective of DC plans is to prudently grow assets to meet spending needs in retirement. If the plan offers funds with active management, a secondary objective may be to outperform the passive asset class returns of the default option’s strategic asset allocation. In environments where participants can voluntarily switch between competing DC plan providers, outperforming other DC plans may be an investment objective.\nHybrid plans also exist that exhibit features of both DB and DC plans. For example, a cash balance plan involves a sponsor defining contributions to assets, which are then pooled; the sponsor faces some of the investment risk, as per a DB plan."

The endowment’s spending policy should ensure intergenerational equity while smoothing payouts to insulate the university from market volatility. To achieve this, the dollar amount of spending each year can be stated as a weighted average of the previous year’s spending (adjusted for inflation) and a spending rate (usually between 4% and 6%) applied to a moving average of assets under management (AUM).

growth rule (w = 1)\nmarket value rule (w = 0)\nhybrid rule (0 < w < 1)\n\nOther liability-related factors that need to be considered are as follows:\nThe lower liquidity requirements, the lower risk tolerance\n\nfundraising from donors\nreliance of the university of the spending from the endowment - All else equal, if the endowment spending comprises a larger proportion of the university’s operating budget, then the risk tolerance of the endowment is lower.\n\n금액은 그대로 dependency가 커짐\n\ncapability of the endowment or university to issue debt - Access to debt markets increases the risk tolerance of the endowment because the institution can borrow to meet spending in times of poor investment performance.\n\n\n\nLiquidity needs\nconstraints\nThe endowment’s annual spending net of gifts and donations is usually very low (around 2% to 4% of assets). Low liquidity needs plus the perpetual time horizon mean endowments usually have a high risk tolerance and absorb relatively high volatility in the shorter term in pursuit of longer-term returns.\n\n\nExternal constraints\nFrom a legal and regulatory perspective, regulation varies by jurisdiction.\nEndowments typically have tax-exempt status when generating investment returns.\n\n\nInvestment objectives\nreturn objectives\nThe investment objective is to preserve the purchasing power of the assets in perpetuity (i.e., grow in line with inflation) while achieving returns adequate to maintain the level of spending. Spending policy can be formulated in different ways; however, a typical spending rate target is 5% of average assets.\nIn practice, this means the university endowment has a primary objective to generate a real return (i.e., after inflation measured using the HEPI) of about 5% on average over a three-to-five-year period. A reasonable volatility limit is typically 10% to 15%. There may be a secondary objective of outperforming a passive benchmark or even a tertiary objective of outperforming a peer group of similar endowments.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Private foundations\n\nMain features / mission\nFoundations are nonprofit institutions set up to make grants to support specified charitable causes.\nThe focus of this reading is on private foundations set up by individual donors and their families. Foundations can also be community foundations set up by and for the good of the local community, operating foundations set up to fund a specific not-for-profit business, or corporate foundations set up from the profits of an existing company.\nThe main objective of private foundations is typically to maintain purchasing power in perpetuity and earn returns sufficient to support the grant-making activities of the foundation (similar to a university endowment’s objective).\n\n\nStakeholders\nThe stakeholders of a private foundation may include the founding family, donors to the foundation, recipients of grants from the foundation, and the wider community that the foundation’s activities may benefit.\n\n\nLiabilities and investment horizon\nexpense 개념\nFoundations typically have an investment horizon that is perpetual.\nIn the United States, tax laws require private grant-making foundations to pay out a minimum of 5% of assets (on a 12-month trailing basis) plus investment expenses.\nUnlike universities, which have other sources of revenue outside the spending of their endowment, foundations are relied upon almost exclusively to meet budgets. This, along with the higher liquidity requirements of foundations, means they typically have a lower risk tolerance than university endowments.\nrisk tolerance는 높은데 lower than endowment\n\n\nLiquidity needs\nU.S. foundations are legally required to spend 5% of assets.\n\n\nExternal constraints\nFoundations typically have similar tax-exempt status to endowments, but this status depends on the minimum spending rules. Failing to meet the spending requirement results in a 30% tax on undistributed income. Most U.S. foundations are also subject to a 2% tax on net investment income.\n\n\nInvestment objective\nThe investment objective is to generate a real return over consumer price inflation of the spending rate (minimum 5%) plus investment expenses, with expected annual volatility in a reasonable range (approximately 10% to 15%) over a three-to-five-year period.\nThere may be a secondary objective of outperforming a policy benchmark based on a tracking error budget.\n\n\nAsset allocation by private foundations\nFoundations have a lower risk tolerance than university endowments due to higher liquidity requirements and the heavy reliance on the foundation’s spending. However, their overall risk tolerance remains high and, with a long-term objective of beating inflation, larger U.S. foundations allocate about half of the portfolio to alternative investments."

    "text": "Bank\n\nMain features / mission\nThe primary function of a bank is to earn profit by taking deposits from savers and making loans to borrowers.\n\n\nStakeholders\nMost major large international banks are publicly listed, making stakeholders are a key external stakeholder with an interest in maximization of profits. Customers of a bank, such as depositors and borrowers, are also key external stakeholders.\nInternal stakeholders include the bank’s employees, managers, and directors.\n\n\nLiabilities and investment horizon\nDeposits constitute the majority of a bank’s liabilities. This include demand deposits-which can be withdrawn without notice and are therefore deemed short term in duration-and time/term deposits that require advance notice before withdrawal.\nOther liabilities include short-term wholesale funding from other financial institutions, long-term debt, and trading/securities payables and repo finance payables.\nThe majority of the assets of a bank are comprised of longer-term illiquid mortgage and commercial loans.\n\n\nLiquidity needs\nWith deposits as short-duration liabilities and the potential need to raise liquidity in adverse market conditions, liquidity management is a key focus for banks.\nBanks lending to commercial markets still tend to use wholesale funding markets more than banks lending to retail markets. Retail banks use a higher level of retail deposits in their funding, which have lower costs and tend to be more stable than wholesale funds, giving retail banks a better liquidity position than commercial banks.\n\n\nExternal constraints\nFrom a legal and regulatory perspective, the risks that a systemic bank failure pose to critical economic functions such as payment processing and extension of credit mean that regulators are intensely focused on capital adequacy, liquidity, and leverage levels.\n\n\nInvestment objectives\nThe primary objective of a bank’s investment portfolio is to manage liquidity and reduce risk mismatches between the bank’s noninvestment assets and liabilities."

    "text": "Insurer\n\nMain features / mission\n\nLife insurers - They write insurance relating to whole life or term insurance with fixed payments, variable life insurance (with payouts linked to returns of investment funds chosen by the policyholder), annuity products, health insurance, and universal life insurance (with flexible premiums and benefit payouts).\nProperty and casualty (P&C) insurers - They write insurance relating to commercial property and liability, home ownership, marine insurance, surety, and legal liabilities.\n\n\n\nStakeholders\nFor traditional life insurance (including universal life) and fixed annuity policies, life insurers maintain a general account to fund the liabilities because the insurer bears the investment risk associated with meeting claims under these contracts. For variable life policies and variable annuities, the insurer operates a separate account in which assets are invested according to the investment choices of policyholders. For these policies, the policyholder bears the investment risk.\n\n\nLiabilities and investment horizon\nInsurance companies manage their investments with a focus on asset and liability management; therefore, the nature of the liabilities is crucial to the investment horizon of the investment portfolio.\nLife insurer generally face a long duration liability stream through their contract payouts, although this can vary by product line. Because of this, life insurance companies have historically set investment horizons of 20 to 40 years.\nP&C insurers generally face a liability stream with a shorter duration and higher uncertainty because claims are related to unlikely, unpredictable events with high payouts, such as natural disasters.\n\nuncertain timing and amount\n\n\n\nLiquidity needs\nAn insurer need to manage both internal liquidity (cash from operations and investing activities) and external liquidity (ability to borrow in debt markets). Liquidity needs are affected by the level of interest rates. In times of high interest rates, policyholders with historically low-yielding contracts may surrender (i.e., cash in) their policies in order to invest at higher yields in other investments, thereby increasing the net cash outflows of the life insurers.\nP&C insurers face significant cash flow uncertainty due to the nature of their liabilities; hence, portfolios require the ample liquidity of high proportions of cash or cash equivalents and short-term fixed-income securities.\nInsurers divide general account investments into two major components: the reserve portfolio and the surplus portfolio. Regulations require the insurer to maintain a reserve portfolio capable of meeting policy liabilities, and is therefore managed conservatively. The surplus portfolio is used to generate higher returns, often by assuming liquidity risk and allocating to alternative investments.\n\n\nExternal constraints\nFrom a legal and regulatory perspective, insurers, like banks, carry out crucial financial intermediary roles and can become large enough to be classified by regulators as SIFIs.\n\n\nInvestment objectives\nSimilar to banks, the primary objective of an insurer’s investment portfolio is to manage liquidity and reduce risk mismatches between the institution’s assets and liabilities."

    "text": "P&C Profitability\nP&C margins are cyclical. During periods of heightened competition, price cutting to obtain new business leads to slim or negative margins (soft pricing period). This soft pricing period leads to losses and a shrinking capital base for many insurers, who either leave the industry or stop underwriting new policies. The resulting reduction in competition leads to a healthier pricing environment (hard pricing period), which in turn results in fatter margins. Higher margins during the hard pricing period attract new competition, perpetuating the cycle.\nMajor expenses for P&C insurers include claims expense and the expense of obtaining new policy business. The cost of writing new policies depends on whether the insurer uses a direct-to-customer model (in which case it would bear the fixed cost of staffing) or the agency model (in which case it would pay variable commissions). Soft or hard pricing is driven by the industry’s combined ratio (total insurance expenses / net premiums earned). When the ratio is low (high), it is a hard (soft) market.\nFor a single insurer, a combined ratio in excess of 100% indicates an underwriting loss.\nUnderwriting loss ratio (loss and loss adjustment expense ratio) = (claims paid + delta of loss reverse) / net premium earned\nExpense ratio (underwriting expense ratio) = underwriting expenses including commissions / net premium written\nThe underwriting loss ratio measures the relative efficiency of the company’s underwriting standards (whether the policies are priced appropriately relative to risks borne), while the expense ratio measures the efficiency of the company’s operations.\nFor reporting purposes, sometimes insurers use US GAAP, which calls for net premium earned as the denominator for both ratios.\nThe loss reverse is an estimated value of unpaid claims (based on estimated losses incurred during the reporting period). Subject to management discretion in measurement, the loss reserve is a highly material amount. Insurers revise their estimate of the loss reserve as more information becomes available. Downward revisions indicate that the company was conservative in estimating their losses in the first place. Upward revisions indicate aggressive profit booking, a warning sign for analysts."

A large increase in DSRI could be indicative of revenue inflation.\n- GMI (Gross margin index) – ratio of gross margin in year t – 1 to that in year t. a firm with declining margins is more likely to manipulate earnings.\n- AQI (Asset quality index) – ratio of non-current assets other than plant, property, and equipment to total assets in year t relative to year t – 1. Increases in AQI could indicate excessive capitalization of expenses.\n- SGI (Sales growth index) – ratio of sales in year t relative to year t – 1. While not a measure of manipulation by itself, growth companies tend to find themselves under pressure to manipulate earnings to meet ongoing expectations.\n- DEPI (Depreciation index) – ratio of depreciation rate in year t – 1 to the corresponding rate in year t. the depreciation rate is depreciation expense divided by depreciation plus PPE. A DEPI greater than 1 suggests that assets are being depreciated at a slower rate in order to manipulate earnings.\n- SGAI (Sales, general and administrative expenses index) – ratio of SGA expenses (as a % of sales) in year t relative to year t – 1. Increases in SGA expenses might predispose companies to manipulate.\n- Accruals = (income before extraordinary items – cash flow from operations) / total assets\n- LEVI (Leverage index) – ratio of total debt to total assets in year t relative to year t – 1.\nThe Beneish model relies on accounting data, which may not reflect economic reality. Additionally, as managers become aware of the use of specific quantitative tools, they may begin to game the measures used."

These asset allocation approaches attempt to match investors’ goals with their optimal level of risk.\nAsset-only approaches make asset allocation decisions based on solely on the investor’s assets. An example of an asset-only approach is mean-variance optimization (MVO), which incorporates the expected returns, volatility, and correlations of asset classes. The investment objective for this approach is to maximize the expected return per unit of risk (e.g., maximize the Sharpe ratio).\nLiability-relative approaches involve asset allocation decisions based on funding liabilities, with the objective of paying liabilities when they come due. An example of a liability-relative approach is surplus optimization, which is based on principles from mean-variance asset allocation. Modeling liabilities may be achieved by shorting an amount of bonds that matches the duration and present value of liabilities. Asset allocation focused on funding liabilities is also known as liability-driven investing (LDI).\nGoals-based approaches are geared toward asset allocations for sub-portfolios, which help individuals or families achieve lifestyle and aspirational financial objectives. For example, goals could involve maintaining a current lifestyle or donating money to a university at some point in the future. In order to achieve the stated goals, it is necessary to specify the type of cash flows needed (e.g., even, uneven, or bullet payment), the time horizon(s), and the level of risk tolerance in terms of the probability of attaining a certain goal. Each sub-portfolio will have a unique asset allocation designed to meet the stated goals, Summing these asset allocations will produce the investor’s overall portfolio strategic asset allocation. Asset allocation focused on investor’s goals is also known as goals-based investing (GBI).\nBoth liability-relative and goals-based allocation approaches are based on meeting liabilities. This suggests that institutional liabilities can be more confidently forecasted since the average of a large number of obligations is more certain than the uncertain time horizon needs of one individual investor.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

The relevant risk measure for MVO, the most popular asset-only approach, is the standard deviation of portfolio returns, which incorporates asset class volatilities and asset class return correlations. Other risk sensitivities, such as relative risk and downside risk, can also be measured with a mean-variance framework. For example, the risk relative to a benchmark can be modeled with tracking error, and downside risk can be modeled with value at risk (VaR), semivariance, or maximum drawdown.\nMonte Carlo simulation is a statistical modeling tool often used to complement MVO. For example, a manager could begin by selecting several optimal portfolios using MVO that have acceptable risk and return for the client and then use Monte Carlo simulation to generate multiple simulated paths, which display how these portfolios would perform over time. (path의 distribution을 볼 수 있음) This action would provide useful information on downside risk when portfolios encounter a market stress scenario. These results can then be used to refine asset allocation decisions.\nRisk concepts associated with liability-relative approaches focus on not having enough assets to pay liabilities when they come due. The volatility of contributions used for funding liabilities is also a risk. The standard deviation of the surplus may be used as the relevant risk measure. In general, the differences between asset and liability characteristics (e.g., size, sensitivity to interest rate changes) are the main drivers of risk for liability relative asset allocation approaches.\nRisk concepts associated with goals-based approaches focus on the risk of not being able to achieve the stated financial goals. If an investor has multiple goals, then the risks will encompass multiple future time periods. Thus, portfolio risk under a goals-based approach is the weighted sum of the risk that is attached to each goal.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

Each asset class has its own quantifiable systematic risk, and strategic asset allocation is a conscious effort to gain the desired exposure to systematic risk via specific weights to individual asset classes. (investment characteristic - return / risk) In other words, strategic asset allocation reflects the investor’s desired systematic risk exposure.\nIn a generic sense, there are three categories of “super asset classes”: 1) capital asset, which provide a continuous source of value (e.g., dividends) (앞으로 cashflow가 발생하는 asset), 2) consumable or transformable assets, which can be consumed or transformed into a source of value (e.g., commodities), and 3) store-of-value asset, which provide value when exchanged or sold (e.g., currencies, art).\nFor the purposes of asset allocation, it is necessary to define asset classes. The following criteria can be used to specify asset classes:\nAsset class classification conditions\n\nAssets in an asset class should have similar attributes from both a descriptive and statistical perspective. → risk and return characteristics are similar. homogeneity\nAssets cannot be classified into more than one asset class. → mutually exclusive\nAsset classes should not be highly correlated.\nAsset classes should cover all possible investable assets.\nAsset classes should contain a sufficiently large percentage of liquid assets.\n\nSome well-accepted asset classes include domestic equity, domestic fixed income, global equity, global fixed income, cash and equivalents, and alternative investments, which may be further divided into classes such as real estate, private equity, et cetera. → availability bias\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nStrategic asset allocation should focus primarily on the asset class divisions that have distinctly different characteristics and will provide diversification. However, when progressing from strategic asset allocation to policy implementation and tactical asset allocation, decisions may focus more on the sub-asset classes."

However, using asset classes in this fashion may be problematic due to overlapping risk factors among asset classes.\nAn investor selects asset classes based on their desired exposure to common risk factors. Examples of risk factors include volatility, liquidity, inflation, interest rates, duration, foreign exchange, and default risk. For example, the asset classes of domestic equity and domestic fixed income will both share exposures to foreign exchange (in the sense that changes in value of the domestic currency can affect profitability of issuers and return on investments in their debt and equity), liquidity, and volatility risk factors.\nDue to overlapping risk factors, it may be insightful to focus on risk factors rather than traditional asset classes as units of analysis.

The second aspect is to decide how investors should make allocations within selected asset classes.\n\nPassive / active choices for asset class weights\nTactical asset allocation (TAA) is an active management strategy that deviates from the strategic asset allocation (SAA) to take advantage of perceived short-term opportunities in the market. These deviations from the SAA weighting by asset class should be restricted by risk budgets or rebalancing ranges that control the amount of deviation. A multiperiod view of the investment horizon is sometimes referred to as dynamic asset allocation (DAA).\nWith tactical asset allocation, there is a tradeoff between potential outperformance and tracking error.

    "text": "Rebalancing\nThe allocation itself is typically specified in a range of percentages (e.g., a strategic allocation for domestic equity of 30% to 40%), and if the actual percentage wanders outside that range, the portfolio needs to be rebalanced. Rebalancing can be triggered by normal asset price changes, which cause the asset mix to fluctuate from its target weights.\nThe primary benefit of rebalancing is maintaining the investor’s desired exposure to systematic risk factors. Only by rebalancing the portfolio (e.g., selling equities and buying debt) will the portfolio return to its original risk and return characteristics as specified in the investor’s IPS.\nRebalancing also provides discipline.\n\nRebalancing approaches\nCalendar rebalancing. Calendar rebalancing is rebalancing the portfolio to its strategic allocation on a predetermined, regular basis (e.g., monthly or quarterly).\nThe primary benefit to calendar rebalancing is that its provides discipline without the requirement for constant monitoring. The drawback is that the portfolio could stray considerably between rebalancing dates and return to its strategic allocation ranges on the rebalancing date.\nPercentage-range rebalancing\nWith this approach, rebalancing is triggered by changes in value rather than calendar dates. The manager sets what are called tolerance bands or corridors that are considered optimal for each asset class. For example, a corridor of 50%\ndata:image/svg+xml;supportsDarkMode=1;base64,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\n5% would indicate that the related asset class must stay within a band of 45% to 55%. If the asset class wanders outside that corridor, which would no doubt mean other classes have violated their corridors also, the portfolio is rebalanced.\nBy not waiting for specified rebalancing dates, range-based rebalancing provides the benefit of minimizing the degree to which asset classes can violate their allocation corridors. Cost is increased by the time and expense of constantly monitoring the portfolio (as compared to only checking valuations on the specified calendar dates) and by potentially more frequent trading.\nWhen applying range-based rebalancing, the following four questions need to be addressed:\n\nWho is ultimately responsible for rebalancing the portfolio?\nHow frequently should the portfolio be monitored for rebalancing decisions?\nWhat is the size of the rebalancing corridors?\nShould rebalancing to target weights be fully or only partially corrected?\n\n\n\nStrategic considerations\nThe optimal width of the corridor for an asset class will depend on the following:\n\nTransaction costs. Obviously, the more expensive it is to trade, the less frequently you should trade. If an asset is particularly illiquid, for example, trading can be quite expensive. In that case, the corridor for the class should be wide.\nRisk tolerance. More (less) risk-averse investors will have tighter (wider) rebalancing corridors.\nCorrelations. The more highly correlated the assets (allocations) in a portfolio, the less frequently the portfolio will require balancing.\nMomentum. If investors believe that current trends will continue, an argument can be made for using wider rebalancing corridors. Conversely, if investors anticipate mean reversion, tighter rebalancing corridors should be applied. → trend following → momentum → wider corridor\nLiquidity. Illiquid investments, such as private equity and real estate, are typically associated with larger trading costs. These liquidity costs encourage the use of wider rebalancing corridors.\nDerivatives. Rather than selling underlying assets, a derivatives overlay strategy can be used to synthetically rebalance a portfolio. This approach results in lower transaction costs, lower taxes, and can be executed quicker and easier compared to rebalancing with only the underlying stock and bonds.\nTaxes. The corridors may also be asymmetric due to tax savings (i.e., loss harvesting)\n\nAsset class volatility also has an impact on optimal corridor width. In the simplest situation, higher volatility most likely calls for narrower corridors in order to control risk. Higher volatility (in the absence of high positive correlation between classes) will lead asset class weights to shift more quickly. → mean reversion → narrower corridor\n\nBut more frequent rebalancing increases transaction costs. This argues for wider corridors to control transaction costs, particularly when those costs are substantial.\nThis argues for narrower corridors to control risk exposure. (Consider this the most likely conclusion.)"

is unique to each individual and is based on the investor’s willingness and capacity to take on risk. A risk-neutral investor will have a lambda of 0, although in practice it is typically assumed to be between 1 and 10 with an average level of 4.\nMaximization problems in general usually also have constraints. In MVO, the constraints typically involve the portfolio weights, but they can also reflect restrictions on portfolio expected return, variance, or both.\nThe most common constraint in MVO is called the budget constraint or the unity constraint, which means the asset weights must add up to 100%. The next most common constraint used in MVO is the nonnegativity constraints, which means all weights in the portfolio are positive and between 0% and 100% (there are no short positions in the SAA).\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nMVO approach assumed:\n\nAll tradable assets were included in the optimization and efficient frontier.\nWe will no longer assume all assets are used or that the efficient frontier constructed from all assets is necessarily optimal for a given investor.\nThat a true risk-free asset exists and the optimal allocation line between the risk-free asset and the efficient frontier identifies an optimal (the market) portfolio that all investors should use (allocating between the tangent portfolio and risk-free asset). That optimal tangent portfolio is the portfolio on the efficient frontier with the highest Sharpe ratio.\nWe will no longer assume a true risk-free asset exists where risk-free means the variance of return is zero and return is uncorrelated with the return of other assets (correlation = 0).\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Criticisms of MVO\n\nGIGO - The quality of the output from the MVO (portfolio allocations) is highly sensitive to the quality of the inputs (i.e., expected returns, variances, and correlations). In other settings, this is often called the “garbage-in-garbage-out” (GIGO) problem. Although all three inputs are a source of estimation error in MVO, expected returns are particularly problematic, so we focus here on addressing the quality of the expected return inputs.\nConcentrated asset class allocations: MVO often identifies efficient portfolios that are highly concentrated in a subset of asset classes, with zero allocation to others; in other words, lowest calculated standard deviation is not the same thing as practical diversification.\n\ncorner allocation problem\n\nSkewness and kurtosis: MVO analysis, by definition, only looks at the first two moments of the return distribution: expected return and variance; it does not take into account skewness or kurtosis. But empirical evidence suggests quite strongly that asset returns are not normally distributed: there is significant skewness and kurtosis in actual returns.\nRisk diversification: MVO identifies an asset allocation diversified across asset classes but not necessarily the sources of risk.\nIgnores liabilities\nSingle-period framework: MVO is a single-period framework that does not take into account interim cash flows or the serial correlation of asset returns from one time period to the next.\n\nThe first two criticisms of MVO-GIGO and concentrated asset allocations-can be addressed by:\n\nimproving the quality of the inputs, particularly expected return\nAdding more constraints beyond the budget constraint and the nonnegativity constraint\nresampling MVO\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

The advantage of this is the derived returns already reflect a highly diversified portfolio and you avoid the tendency of MVO to come up with highly concentrated (in a few asset classes) allocations.\nThe Black-Litterman model is an extension of reverse optimization in which the implied returns (actually implied excess returns) from a reverse optimization are subsequently adjusted to reflect the investor’s unique views of future returns.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Issues for individuals\nSo far, we have only considered tradable financial assets such as equities and bonds. However, a significant portion of the typical investor’s asset portfolio is human capital, as well as the residential real estate property the investor owns and lives in. We can adapt the MVO framework to incorporate these kinds of assets into the analysis.\nFor investors who have stable jobs with consistent wages that increase with inflation, we can model the cash flows associated with human capital (future wages) as an inflation-linked bond. For individuals with less certain and more volatile future wages, we could model their human capital as a mix of inflation-linked bonds, equities, and corporate bonds. By including this course of economic value in the investor’s portfolio, the individual’s capacity to take on additional risk is increased. → diversification effect increases\nResidential real estate owned by the investor can be treated in a similar fashion, with return and risk inputs estimated using a residential real estate property index for the investor’s geographic region. Once again, the allocation to the property must be constrained to its current value as a percentage of the investor’s total portfolio.\nBecause human capital and residential real estate property are two large but often overlooked components of an investor’s total investment portfolio, including them in the analysis along with traditional investment vehicles increases the investor’s capacity to bear risk.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Risk budgeting approach\nThe goal of risk budgeting is to maximize return per unit of risk, where we can define risk as total portfolio risk, active risk, or residual risk. (tracking error)\nThe marginal contribution to portfolio risk is the change in total portfolio risk for a small change in the asset allocation to a specific asset class. For those of you with calculus backgrounds, it’s the partial derivative of risk with respect to changes in portfolio allocations. Absolute contribution to total risk (ACTR) is the asset classes’ contribution to portfolio volatility.\nBy estimating each asset classes’ marginal contribution to total risk (MCTR), we can 1) see what happens to portfolio risk as we change individual allocations, 2) identify optimal allocations, and 3) develop a risk budget.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThe optimal allocations to each asset class occur when the ratio of excess return to MCTR is equal for all asset classes and is equal to the portfolio Sharpe ratio.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nNote also that the portfolio Sharpe ratio of 5% / 12%  0.417 is equal to the ratio of excess return to MCTR for both U.S. equities and U.S. bonds. Therefore, the 60/30/10 allocation is optimal from a risk-budgeting perspective.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Liability-relative asset allocation\nInstitutional investors such as pension funds, insurance companies, and banks. All three have liabilities they are obligated to meet at some point in the future, and they face strict regulatory rules and penalties for failure to meet those obligations.\nLet’s use the example of a defined benefit (DB) pension plan to illustrate the key issues and provide some definitions. There are two components to a DB pension plan: the pension liability and the investment portfolio that is managed to meet the cash flow requirements of the liability.\nA pension plan is fully funded if the funding ratio = 1 (which means the plan surplus is 0). An underfunded plan has a funding ratio less than 1, and an overfunded plan has a funding ratio greater than 1.\nThe characteristics of the pension liability drive the return and risk requirements of the investment portfolio and ultimately the asset allocation decision. Furthermore, the analysis should recognize that the value of the assets and the liabilities are driven by some of the same factors, so the correlations between changes in value of the two are

then proceed with the same MVO as previous, except we also include the expected returns and variances of the liabilities. The correlations reflect the extent to which the assets are useful to hedge the liabilities.\nThere are a number of ways to estimate the expected returns and variances of the liabilities. The first is to make the assumption that the liabilities behave like corporate bonds and the liability inputs can be estimated using the expected return and volatility of corporate bonds. The second is to use a factor approach and identify the common factors that affect both the asset classes and the liabilities."

    "text": "Two-portfolio approach (also known as the hedging or return-seeking approach)\nWe create an asset portfolio that hedges the liabilities, and the remainder is managed independently using MVO to maximize utility and identify the optimal risk-return tradeoff.\nThe hedging portfolio can be created using the various techniques outlined else where in the Level III curriculum fixed-income readings: cash flow matching, duration matching, and immunization.\nThis approach is most often used for insurance companies and overfunded pension plans that want to minimize the risk of underfunding.\nThis approach can be modified by 1) only partially hedging the liabilities and allocating more capital to the return-seeking portfolio or 2) increasing the allocation to the hedging portfolio as the funding ratio and the surplus increase. Both of these approaches are more aggressive than completely hedging the liabilities, as they trade off higher expected return for higher risk.\nThere are two limitations of this approach:\n\nIf the funding ratio is less than one, it’s difficult to create a hedging portfolio that completely hedges the liabilities.\nA hedging portfolio may not be available to hedge certain kinds of risk (like earthquakes)."

    "text": "Integrated asset-liability approach\nAsset-Liability Management\nThe distinctive feature of the previous two approaches is that the composition of the liabilities is already in place when the asset allocation decisions are made, so the two decisions are made independently. Banks, hedge funds with short positions, and insurance companies, however, make decisions about the composition of their liabilities jointly with their asset allocation decisions. There is a continuous feedback loop between the two, which requires a multiperiod model. This is often referred to as an integrated asset-liability approach.\nFor example, a key risk by large global banks, which are very highly leveraged, is whether the bank’s capital is sufficient to absorb losses when their asset values decline, their liability values increase, or both. And as both bank assets (loans) and liabilities (deposits) are affected by changes in interest rates, although to varying degrees, stress testing requires a framework that can simultaneously account for both sides of the balance sheet. An integrated asset-liability approach is therefore necessary for banks to identify the optimal mix of assets and liabilities to meet their return and risk objectives.\n\n\n\nUntitled"

    "text": "Endowment model or Yale model\nUnder this approach, you allocate larger amounts to alternative investment asset classes (private equity, real estate, or natural resources) than is typically recommended by a strict MVO. Presumably these markets are less-than-perfectly informationally efficient, so investment managers with expertise in these markets can outperform expectations. Also, they are less liquid, and certain institutional investors are positioned to take on additional liquidity risk in return for a liquidity premium because of their longer time horizons."

The criticism of this approach is that it ignores expected returns and focuses only on risk."

    "text": "Rebalancing policy\nInvestment managers rebalance portfolios for a number of reasons, including in response to changing client goals and capital market expectations or changes in tactical allocations. Definition: adjusting asset allocations to move toward the originally defined strategic allocation goal. Percentage range rebalancing involves setting trigger points around the optimal percentage allocation and rebalancing back to the target allocation or partially correcting when those trigger points are hit. + calendar rebalancing\nThe key factors that impact the optimal corridor width (or the rebalancing range) of an asset class include transaction costs, risk tolerance, correlations with the rest of the portfolio, and the volatility of the rest of the

higher the transaction costs, the wider the optimal corridor, as the benefits of rebalancing have to “pay” for higher costs to rebalance. The higher the investor’s risk tolerance, the wider the corridor, because the investor is less concerned about deviations from the optimal allocation. The higher the correlation of the asset class with the rest of the portfolio, the wider the corridor, because a portfolio tends to move with the asset class, and the allocations tend to stray more slowly from the target. Finally, the higher the volatility of the asset classes, the narrower the optimal corridor.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nUltimately, the choice of corridor width depends on a trade-off between risk control, transaction costs, and correlations between classes."

    "text": "Additional constraints when choosing an optimal asset allocation\n\nAsset size\ninvestable asset size\n\nSmaller funds often lack the expertise and governance structure to invest in complex strategies, and therefore, often face a problem of how to achieve an adequate level of diversification.\nLarger portfolios can generally access greater management expertise in the governance capacity, allowing them to consider complex strategies that smaller funds cannot.\nFunds that are too large may not be able to take advantage of asset classes that lack the capacity to absorb large amounts of funds.\nVery large funds may find that there are not enough alternative investments (e.g., too few hedge funds) available and may choose a fund-of-funds (FoF). But this carries a double fee structure for the FoF manager and the underlying fund managers.\n\n\n\nLiquidity needs\nThe key to successfully addressing the liquidity constraint for a portfolio is to integrate the needs of the owner and the characteristics of the asset class.\nTypical liquidity needs\nThe possibility of extreme market conditions should also be considered when planning liquidity levels.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\nTime horizon\nA portfolio’s time horizon is defined by 1) a liability to be paid (liability relative asset allocation) or 2) a goal to be funded (goals-based approach) at a future date.\nThe changing nature of liabilities over time also requires changes in asset allocation.\nThe time horizon is also associated with the ability to take on risk. Portfolios with longer time horizons are often invested in assets with higher risk. There is evidence that risky asset returns mean revert over time, evening out below and above average levels of return. This concept is known as time diversification.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nThere is no formula to determine the numbers."

In turns, this increases the risk that low returns increase the required contributions. However, there is a benefit in that the higher expected return would decrease the present value of expected contributions.\nThe fund will need to decide on the optimal combination of risk (that contributions exceed a given level) and return (as measured by the PV of expected contributions) whilst taking into account the external regulatory requirements and allocation limits.\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\nEndowments and foundations\nEndowments and foundations are both assumed to have an infinite time horizon and are subject to very few regulatory constraints compared to other entities. The long time horizon usually allows investment in risky assets, but if the endowment is part of the funding of an organization, covenants placed on the organization by lenders may constrain the activities of the portfolio.\n\n\nSovereign wealth funds\nSovereign wealth funds are government-owned entities investing on behalf of the state, and are typically not looking to match assets and liabilities."

are two strategies that can be employed to reduce the impact of taxation:\n\ntax loss harvesting\nstrategic asset location\n\nTax loss harvesting involves deliberately realizing losses to offset gains elsewhere. Strategic asset location involves making the most efficient use of tax advantageous accounts.\nAsset placed in tax-exempt accounts need no adjustment to their market value before being included in the asset allocation process. However, the value of assets in tax-deferred and taxable accounts should be reduced by the tax burden.\nThe portfolio optimization process should consider both the asset classes available and the asset location. (asset location은 account를 의미) It should use two for each asset class, depending on whether they are placed in the taxable or tax-deferred accounts.\nAlthough liquidity needs for consumption should always be considered (e.g., assets allocated to pension accounts may not be accessible without incurring financial penalties), the following general rules should be applied when considering asset location:\n\nAsset subject to the lowest tax rates (typically equity) should be first allocated to taxable accounts.\nAsset subject to frequent trading and high tax rates should be allocated to tax-advantaged accounts."

Target-date mutual funds, for example, adjust allocations for individual investors depending on their age. Such funds use a glide-path and shift from equity to more conservative investments (nominal and inflation-protected bonds) as the target date of the fund approaches."

Fundamental data such as the deviation of P/E, P/B ratios and dividend yield from their historic means may also be used. Economic sentiment can be gauged using a consumer confidence index.\nMarket sentiment can be assessed using:\n\nMargin borrowing (신용매수) - Increasing purchases on margin drives up prices and indicates investors are bullish, although if the level of margin buying gets too high, it can be a bearish sign and indicates investors are overenthusiastic.\nShort interest (aggregate amount of short selling, 공매도 잔고) - This is essentially the opposite. Increasing short interest drives down prices and indicates investors are bearish, although very high levels could indicate the market is at or near a low.\nVolatility indices\n\nA systematic approach takes a more quantitative view. It attempts to capture excess returns using strategies that have historically been predictable and persistent. Two of the main factors that may be exploited are value and momentum.\nA value approach aims to exploit the excess return of value stocks over growth stocks.\nA momentum strategy assumes that trends will persist, which is why recent price movements are used to indicate whether to overweight or underweight an asset class.\n\nMost recent 12-month trend\nMoving-average crossover"

    "text": "Behavioral issues\nBehavioral biases can cause problems during the asset allocation process.\nLoss aversion is a bias in which investors dislike losses more than they like gains. This makes it difficult for investors to maintain discipline when returns are negative. There is a strong temptation to alter the asset allocation. Goals-based investing can help overcome the loss aversion bias. Goals are prioritized and subportfolios are used.\nIllusion of control is a tendency to overestimate the ability to control events. Combined with overconfidence, it typically leads to investors failing to diversify, trading too frequently, or both.\nTo counter the illusion of control, the market portfolio derived from the basic CAPM mean-variance framework should be used as the starting point for the allocation, and shifts in allocation away from this position should be subject to a formal review process.\nMental accounting involves separating assets and liabilities into different “buckets” based on subjective criteria. Mental accounting often leads to suboptimal asset allocations and less chance of meeting the goal.\nRepresentative bias, or recency bias, occurs when investors attach more importance to recent data than old data. The most common result is for an investor to shift allocations towards asset that have performed well recently.\nFraming bias occurs when the way information is presented affects the resulting decision. This is common problem in asset allocation. If risk is presented as standard deviation, most investors prefer the lower risk. But downside risk measures may be more useful in specific situation.\n\nVaR indicates amounts of loss at some probability over a time.\nConditional VaR quantifies the average loss within the VaR tail.\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\nAvailability bias occurs when personally experienced or more easily recalled events disproportionately influence decisions. Investors make availability bias mistakes if they benchmark their portfolio performance to that of other investors, without regard to whether those other investors have comparable goals and constraints.\n\nFamiliarity bias may be considered an offshoot of availability in that what is familiar or easy to recall is given too much importance in the decision process.\nHome bias can be considered another offshoot and is often seen in portfolios that over allocate to domestic securities, missing the opportunity to diversify with international securities.\n\nStarting the allocation process with the global market portfolio can help to mitigate availability biases in the asset allocation process."

This approach estimates a firm’s value as the sum of the market value of the assets it owns or controls. This approach is commonly used to value firms that own or control natural resources, such as oil fields, coal deposits, and other mineral claims.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928152430326\n\n\nAnother very common approach to valuation is to determine the value of an asset in relation to the values of other assets.\n\n\n\n\nRather than valuing a company as a single entity, an analysts can value individual parts of the firm and add them up to determine the value of the company as a whole.

In this case, a model based on cash flow may be more appropriate than one based on dividends because a controlling interest would allow the purchaser to set dividend policy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928153839545\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the expected return is not equal to required return, there can be a “return from convergence of price to intrinsic value”.\n\n\n\nimage-20210928153936586\n\n\n만약 expected return = 20%, required rate of return = 10%이면, 이 차이에서 발생하는 convergence에서 오는 return을 price convergence라고 함\n\n\n\n\nequity risk premium = required return on equity index - risk-free rate\n\n\nA historical estimate of the equity risk premium consists of the difference between the historical mean return for a broad-based equity-market index and a risk-free rate over a given time period.\nA weakness of the approach is the assumption that the mean and variance of the returns are constant over time. In fact, the premium actually appears to be countercyclical-it is low during good times and high during bad times.\nThe historical estimate can also be upward biased if only firms that have survived during the period of measurement (called survivorship bias) are included in the sample.\nThe risk premium is always be lower when the geometric mean is used instead of the arithmetic mean. If the yield curve is upward sloping, the use of longer-term bonds rather than shorter-term bonds to estimate the risk-free rate will cause the estimated risk premium to be smaller.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928155312172\n\n\nA weakness of the approach is that the forward-looking estimates will change through time and need to be updated.\nAnother weakness is the assumption of a stable growth rate, which is often not appropriate in rapidly growing economies.\n\n\n\nimage-20210928161607976\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928155423600\n\n\nMacroeconomic model estimates of the equity risk premium are based on the relationships between macroeconomic variables and financial variables.\nbreak-even inflation rate = (1 + YTM of 20-year T-bonds) / (1 + YTM of 20-year TIPS) - 1\nExpected real growth rate in EPS should be approximately equal to the real GDP growth rate.

The baseline value for the liquidity factor beta is zero. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{required return of stock}j = RF + \\beta_{mkt, j} * (R_{mkt} - RF) + \\beta_{SMB, j} * (R_{small} - R_{big}) + \\beta_{HML, j} * (R_{HBM} - R_{LBM}) + \\beta_{liq, j} * (R_{illiq} - R_{liq})\n\\]\n\n\n\nMacroeconomic multifactor models use factors associated with economic variables that can be reasonably believed to affect cash flows and/or appropriate discount rates. The Burmeister, Roll, and Ross model incorporates the following five factors:\n\nConfidence risk - unexpected changes in the difference between the return of risky corporate bonds and government bonds.\nTime horizon risk - unexpected change in the difference between the return of long-term government bonds and Treasury bills.\nInflation risk - unexpected changes in the inflation rate.\nBusiness cycle risk - unexpected change in the level of real business activity.\nMarket timing risk - the equity market return that is not explained by the other four factors.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928165331662\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{required return} = RF + \\operatorname{equity risk premium} + \\operatorname{size premium} + \\operatorname{specific-company\\, premium}\n\\]\nThe formula could have a factor for the level of controlling versus minority interests and a factor for marketability of the equity; however, these latter two factors are usually used to adjust the value of the company directly rather than through the required return.\nprivate company valuation formula 사용\nother risk premium (specific-company premium): marketability / control 반영되는 부분인데 risk premium보다는 Cashflow (value)에 직접 영향 - DCF 할 때 CF에 영향\n\n\n\nThe method simply adds a risk premium to the yield to maturity (YTM) of the company’s long-term debt. The logic here is that the yield to maturity of the company’s bonds includes the effects of inflation, leverage, and the firm’s sensitivity to the business cycle. That value is usually estimated at 3-5%, with the specific estimate based upon some model or simply from experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPopular choices for the index include the S&P 500 and the NYSE Composite. The most common length and frequency are five years of monthly data.\n\n\n\nWhen making forecasts of the equity risk premium, some analysts recommend adjusting the beta for beta drift. Beta drift refers to the observed tendency of an estimated beta to revert to a value of 1.0 over time. To compensate, the Blume method can be used to adjust the beta estimate: \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{adjusted beta} = (2 / 3 * \\operatorname{regression beta}) + (1 / 3 * 1.0)\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nIdentify a benchmark company, which is publicly traded and similar to target company’s operations.\nEstimate the beta of that benchmark company. This can be done with a regression analysis.\nUnlever the beta estimate \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{unlevered beta of benchmark company} = \\operatorname{beta of benchmark company} * \\frac{1}{1 + \\frac{\\operatorname{debt of benchmark company}}{\\operatorname{equity of benchmark company}}}\n\\] {b}\nLever up the unlevered beta \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{estimate of beta for target company} = \\operatorname{unlevered beta of benchmark company} * (1 + \\frac{\\operatorname{debt of target company}}{\\operatorname{equity of target company}})\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928165532985\n\n\n\n\n\nInternational investment, if not hedged, exposes the investor to exchange rate risk.\n\n\nOne method for adjusting data from emerging markets is to use a corresponding developed market as a benchmark and add a premium for the emerging market. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{Emerging ERP} = \\operatorname{Developed equity risk premium} + \\operatorname{Country premium}\n\\\\\\operatorname{Country premium} = \\operatorname{Emerging market bond yield} - \\operatorname{developed market bond yield}\n\\]\n\n\n\nA second method is the country risk rating model. This model estimates a regression equation using the equity risk premium for developed countries as the depended variables and risk ratings for those countries as the independent variable. The model is then used for predicting the equity risk premium for emerging markets using the emerging markets risk-ratings.\nDeveloped market의 risk rating (independent variable)과 ERP (dependent variable)을 regression analysis -> emerging market의 risk rating을 대입하여 ERP 추정\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{WACC} = \\frac{\\operatorname{market value of debt}}{\\operatorname{market value of debt and equity}} * r_{d} * (1 - t) + \\frac{\\operatorname{market value of equity}}{\\operatorname{market value of debt and equity}} * r_{e}\n\\]\nthe tax rate should be the marginal tax rate.\nthe WACC calculation should use the target weights for debt and equity.\n\n\n\n\nCash flows to the firm - WACC\nCash flows to equity - required rate on equity\nNominal cash flows - nominal discount rates\nReal cash flows - real discount rates\n\n\n\n\nBottom-up analysis starts with analysis of an individual company or its reportable segments.\nTop-down analysis begins with expectations about a macroeconomic variable, often the expected growth rate of nominal GDP.\nA hybrid analysis incorporates elements of both top-down and bottom-up analysis. A hybrid analysis can highlights any inconsistencies in assumptions between the top-down and bottom-up approaches. A hybrid analysis is the most common type.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928171050936\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the average cost of production decreases as industry sales increase, we say that the industry exhibits economies of scale.\nEconomies of scale are observed when larger companies in an industry have larger margins.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause cost of goods sold is closely related to revenue, future COGS is usually estimated as a percentage of future revenue: \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{forecast COGS} = \\operatorname{historical COGS} / \\operatorname{revenue} * \\operatorname{estimate of future revenue}\n\\\\\\operatorname{or}\n\\\\\\operatorname{forecast COGS} = (1 - \\operatorname{gross margin}) * \\operatorname{estimate of future revenue}\n\\] It can be worthwhile to examine the gross margins of a firm’s competitor in the market as a check of the reasonableness of future gross margin estimates. In some cases, differences between firms’ business models may be the underlying reason for differences in gross margins.\nA closer examination of the volume and price of a firm’s inputs may improve the quality of a forecast of COGS, especially in the short run. An analyst must be aware of the proportion of future input costs hedged in this way or, at a minimum, whether the firm has historically hedged these costs and over what horizon.\nEstimates of a firm’s COGS may also be improved by forecasting COGS for the firm’s various product categories and business segments separately.\n\n\n\nCompared to COGS, SG&A operating expenses are less sensitive to changes in sales volume; SG&A fixed cost component is generally greater than its variable cost component.\nSelling and distribution costs, on the other hand, may be more directly related to sales volumes, because it is likely that more salespeople will be hired to support higher firm sales. If a firm’s financial statements break out the components of SG&A separately, the different components can be considered separately to improve the overall forecast of SG&A expenses.\n\n\n\nThe primary determinants of gross interest expense are the level of (gross) debt and market interest rates.\nNet debt is gross debt minus cash, cash equivalents, and short-term securities.\nNet interest expense is gross interest expense minus interest income on cash and short-term debt securities.\n\n\n\n\nstatutory rate\neffective tax rate\ncash tax rate\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928172318121\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet income less dividends declared will flow through to retained earnings. Working capital items can be forecast based on their historical relationship with income statement items.\nThe forecasted annual COGS divided by the inventory turnover ratio can be used to forecast an inventory value for the balance sheet that is consistent with income statement projections of COGS. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{projected accounts receivable} = \\operatorname{days sales outstanding} * \\operatorname{forecasted sales} / 365\n\\] Working capital items will increase at the same rate as revenues.\nProperty, plant and equipment (PP&E) on the balance sheet is determined by depreciation and capital expenditures (capex).\nForecasts may also be improved by analyzing capital expenditures for maintenance separately from capital expenditure for growth. Historical depreciation should be increased by the inflation rate when estimating capital expenditure for maintenance because replacement cost can be expected to increase with inflation.\n\n\n\nimage-20210928172921226\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928172926084\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce financial projections are completed, the return on invested capital (ROIC) can be calculated. While analysis use varying definitions of ROIC, it can be thought of as net operating profit projected for taxes (NOPLAT) divided by invested capital (operating assets minus operating liabilities). ROIC is a return to both equity and debt and is preferable to return on equity (ROE) in some contexts because it allows (relative to their peers) are likely exploiting some competitive advantage in the production and/or sale of their products.\nA related measure, return on capital employed, is similar to ROIC but uses pretax operating earnings in the numerator to facilitate comparison between companies that face different tax rates.\n\n\n\nimage-20210928173304640\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA firm’s future competitive success is possibly the most important factor in determining future revenue and profitability.\n\n\n\nthreat of substitute products\nintensity of industry rivalry\nbargaining power of suppliers\nbargaining power of customers\nthreat of new entrants\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928173651908\n\n\n가격 인상 시 demand elasticity에 대한 고려 필요 - 탄력적이면 price 상승 시 revenue 하락, 비탄력적이면 price 상승 시 revenue 하락이 덜함\nprice-volume trade-off: inflation 상황에서 가격 인상이 늦으면 profit margin이 낮아짐, 빠르면 profit margin은 유지되지만 volume이 내려갈 수 있음\nCompanies with commodity-type inputs can hedge their exposure to changes in input prices through derivatives or, more simply, fixed-price contracts for future delivery. - hedge\nCompanies that are vertically integrated (and are in effect their own suppliers) will be less subject to the effects of variations in input prices. - vertical integration\nFor a company that neither hedges input price exposure nor is vertically integrated the issue for the analyst is to determine how rapidly, and to what extent, the increase in costs can be passed on to customers, as well as the expected effect of price increases on sales volume and sales revenue.\nThe effects of increasing a product’s price depend on the product’s elasticity of demand. For most firms, product demand is relatively elastic. With elastic demand, the percentage reduction in unit sales is greater than the percentage increase in price, and a price increase will decrease total sales revenue.\nThe elasticity of demand is most affected by the availability of substitute products. In a competitive industry, the pricing decisions of other firms in the industry can affect the market shares of all firms in an industry.\nFirms that are too quick to increase prices will experience declining sales volumes, though firms that are slow to increase prices will experience declining gross margins.\n\n\n\nSome advances in technology decrease costs of production, which will increase profit margins (at least for early adopters), and, over time, increase industry supply and unit sales as well.\nOther advances in technology will result in either improved substitutes or wholly new products. Some technological advances can disrupt not only markets but entire industries. One way for an analyst to model the introduction of new substitutes for a company’s products is to estimate a cannibalization factor, which is the percentage of new product sales that will replace existing product sales. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{cannibalization rate} = \\frac{\\operatorname{new product sales that replace existing product sales}}{\\operatorname{total new product sales}}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928175154104\n\n\n\n\n\nAn analyst will typically value a stock using the earnings or some measures of cash flow over a forecast period, along with the stock’s terminal value at the end of the forecast horizon. This terminal value is usually estimated using either a relative valuation approach or a discounted cash flow approach.\nWhen using a multiples approach, an analyst must ensure that the multiple used is consistent with the estimate of the company’s growth rate and required rate of return.\nWhen using a discounted cash flow approach to estimate the terminal value, two key inputs are a cash flow or earnings measure and an expected future growth rate.\n\n\n\nSteps in developing a sales-based pro forma model:\n\nEstimate revenue growth and future expected revenue\nEstimate COGS\nEstimate SG&A\nEstimate financing costs\nEstimate income tax expense and cash taxes\nEstimate cash taxes, taking into account changes in deferred tax items\nModel the balance sheet based on items that flow from the income statement\nUse depreciation and capital expenditures (for maintenance and for growth) to estimate capital expenditures and net PP&E for the balance sheet\nUse the completed pro forma income statement and balance sheet to construct a pro forma cash flow statement\n\n\n\n\n \\[\n\\\\FCFF = NI + NCC + Interest * (1 -

The ownership perspective implicit in the dividend discount approach is that of a minority owner who has no direct control over the firm’s dividend policy.\nAnalysts often prefer to use free cash flow rather than dividend-based valuation for the following reasons:\n\nmany firms pay no, or low, cash dividends\nDividends are paid at the discretion of the board of directors. It may consequently, be poorly aligned with the firm’s long-run profitability.\nIf a company is vied as an acquisition target, free cash flow is a more appropriate measure because the new owner will have discretion over tis distribution (control perspective).\nFree cash flows may be more related to long-run profitability of the firm as compared to dividends.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\FCFF = NI + NCC + Interest * (1 - t) - FCInv - WCInv\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928221457064\n\n\nThe most significant noncash charge is usually depreciation.\n\nAmortization of intangibles should be added back to net income, much like depreciation.\nProvisions for restructuring charges and other noncash losses should be added back to net income. However, if the firm is accruing these costs to cover future cash outflows, then the forecast of future free cash flow should be reduced accordingly. Gains or losses on sale of long-term assets are also removed (they would be accounted for under fixed capital investment).\nIncome from restructuring charge reversals and other noncash gains should be subtracted from net income.\nFor a bond issuer, the amortization of a bond discount should be added back to net income, and the accretion of the bond premium should be subtracted from net income to calculate FCFF.\nDeferred taxes, which result from differences in the timing of reporting income and expenses for accounting versus tax purposes, must be carefully analyzed. Over time, differences between book and taxable income should offset each other and have no significant effect on overall cash flows. If, however, the analyst expects deferred tax liabilities to continue to increase, increases in deferred tax liabilities should be added back to net income. Increases in deferred tax assets that are not expected to reverse should be subtracted from net income.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210928224141856\n\n\nFixed capital investment is a net amount: it is equal to the difference between capital expenditures (investments in long-term fixed assets) and the proceeds from the sale of long-term assets: \\[\n\\\\\\text{If no long-term assets were sold during the year,}\n\\\\FCInv = \\operatorname{ending\\, net\\, PP\\&E} - \\operatorname{beginning\\, net\\, PP\\&E} + depreciation\n\\\\\\text{If long-term assets were sold during the year,}\n\\\\FCInv = \\operatorname{ending\\, net\\, PP\\&E} - \\operatorname{beginning\\, net\\, PP\\&E} + depreciation - \\operatorname{gain on sale}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe investment in net working capital is equal to the change in working capital, excluding cash, cash equivalents, notes payable, and the current portion of long-term debt.\n\n\n\nOnly the after-tax interest cost because paying interest reduces our tax bill.\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\FCFF = EBIT * (1 - t) + Dep - FCInv - WCInv\n\\]\nBecause many noncash adjustments occur on the income statement below EBIT, we don’t need to adjust for them when calculating free cash flwo if we start with EBIT.\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\FCFF = EBITDA * (1 - t) + Dep * t - FCInv - WCInv\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\FCFF = CFO + Int * (1 - t) - FCInv\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\FCFE = FCFF - Int * (1 - t) + \\operatorname{net borrowing}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\FCFE = NI + NCC - FCInv - WCInv + \\operatorname{net borrowing}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\FCFE = CFO - FCInv + \\operatorname{net borrowing}\n\\]\n\n\n\nRemember to treat preferred stock just like debt, except preferred dividends are not tax deductible.\nSpecifically, any preferred dividends should be added back to the FCFF, just as after-tax interest charges are in the net income approach to generating FCFF. This approach assumes that net income is net income to common shareholders after preferred dividends have been subtracted out. The only adjustment to FCFE would be to modify net borrowing to reflect new debt borrowing and net issuance by the amount of the preferred stock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first method is to calculate historical free cash flow and apply a growth rate under the assumptions that growth will be constant and fundamental factors will be maintained.\nThe second method is to forecast the underlying components of free cash flow and calculate each year separately. \\[\n\\\\FCFE = NI - (1 - DR) * (FC_{I} - Dep + WC_{I})\n\\\\DR =\\frac{Debt}{Debt + Equity} = \\operatorname{Debt Ratio}\n\\]\n\n\n\nThe free cash flow to equity approach takes a control perspective that assumes that recognition of value should be immediate.

The economic rationale for the method of comparables is the Law of One Price, which assets that two similar assets should sell at comparable price multiples.\nThe method of forecasted fundamentals values a stock based on the ratio of its value from a discounted cash flow (DCF) model to some fundamental variable. The economic rationale for the method of forecasted fundamentals is that the value used in the numerator of the justified price multiple is derived from a DCF model.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA justified price multiple is what the multiple should be if the stock is fairly valued. If the actual multiple is greater than the justified price multiple, the stock is overvalued; if the actual multiple is less than the justified multiple, the stock is undervalued (all else equal).\n\n\nThere are a number of rationales for using price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in valuation:\n\nEarnings power, as measured by earnings per share (EPS), is the primary determinant of investment value.\nThe P/E ratio is popular in the investment community.\nEmpirical research shows that P/E differences are significantly related to long-run average stock returns.\n\nP/E ratio have a number of shortcomings:\n\nEarnings can be negative, which produces a meaningless P/E ratio.\nThe volatile, transitory portion of earnings makes the interpretation of P/Es diffciult for analysts.\nManagement discretion within allowed accounting practices can distort reported earnings, and thereby lessen the comparability of P/Es across firms.\n\n \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{trailing\\, P/E} = \\frac{\\operatorname{market price per share}}{EPS over previous 12 months}\n\\\\\\operatorname{leading\\, P/E} = \\frac{\\operatorname{market price per share}}{\\operatorname{forecasted EPS over next 12 months}}\n\\] Trailing P/E is not useful for forecasting and valuation if the firm’s business has changed. Leading P/E may not be relevant if earnings are sufficiently volatile so that next year’s earnings are not forecastable with any degree of accuracy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929011159080\n\n\nAdvantages of using the price-to-book (P/B) ratio include:\n\nBook value is a cumulative amount that is usually positive, even when the firm reports a loss and EPS is negative. Thus, a P/B can typically be used when P/E cannot.\nBook value is more stable than EPS, so it may be more useful than P/E when EPS is particularly high, low, or volatile.\nBook value is an appropriate measure of net asset value for firms that primarily hold liquid assets. Examples include finance, investment, insurance, and banking firms.\nP/B can be useful in valuing companies that are expected to go out of business.\nEmpirical research shows that P/Bs help explain differences in long-run average stock return.\n\nDisadvantages of using P/B include:\n\nP/Bs do not reflect the value of intangible economic assets, such as human capital.\nP/Bs can be misleading when there are significant differences in the asset size of the firms under consideration because in some cases the firm’s business model dictates the size of its asset base.\nDifferent accounting conventions can obscure the true investment in the firm made by shareholders, which reduces the comparability of P/Bs across firms and countries.\nInflation and technological change can cause the book and market values of assets to differ significantly, so book value is not an accurate measure of the value of shareholders’ investment.\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{P/B\\, ratio} = \\frac{\\operatorname{market value of equity}}{\\operatorname{book value of equity}} = \\frac{\\operatorname{market price per share}}{\\operatorname{book value per share}}\n\\\\\\operatorname{book value of equity} = \\operatorname{common\\, shareholders'\\, equity} = \\operatorname{total assets} - \\operatorname{total liabilities} - \\operatorname{preferred stock}\\\\\n\\]\nA common adjustment is to use tangible book value, which is equal to book value of equity less intangible assets. Balance sheets should be adjusted for significant off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities and for differences between the fair and recorded value of assets and liabilities. Finally, book values often need to be adjusted to ensure comparability.\n\n\n\nThe advantages of using the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio include:\n\nSales revenue is always positive.\nSales revenue is not as easy to manipulate.\nP/S ratios are not as volatile as P/E multiples.\nP/S ratios are particularly appropriate for valuing stocks in mature or cyclical industries and start-up companies with no record of earnings.\nLike P/E and P/B ratios, empirical research finds that differences in P/S are significantly related to differences in long-run average stock returns.\n\nThe disadvantages of using P/S ratios include:\n\nHigh growth in sales does not necessarily indicate high operating profits as measured by earnings and cash flow.\nP/S ratios do not capture differences in cost structures across companies.\nWhile less subject to distortion, revenue recognition practices can still distort sales forecasts.\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{P/S\\, ratio} = \\frac{\\operatorname{market value of equity}}{\\operatorname{total sales}} = \\frac{\\operatorname{market price per share}}{\\operatorname{sales per share}}\n\\]\n\n\n\nAdvantages of using the price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio include:\n\nCash flow is harder for managers to manipulate than earnings.\nPrice to cash flow is more stable than price to earnings.\nReliance on cash flow rather than earnings handles the problem of differences in the quality of reported earnings, which is problem for P/E.\nEmpirical evidence indicates that differences in price to cash flow are significantly related to differences in long-run average stock returns.\n\nThere are two drawbacks to the price-to-cash flow ratio:\n\nItems affecting actual cash flow from operations are ignored when the EPs plus noncash charges estimate is used. For example, noncash revenue and net changes in working capital are ignored.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, free cash flow to equity (FCFE) is preferable to operating cash flow. However, FCFE is more volatile than operating cash flow, so it is not necessarily more informative.\n\n\n\n\nAdvantages of the dividend yield approach include:\n\nDividend yield contributes to total investment return.\nDividends are not as risky as the capital appreciation component of total return.\n\nDisadvantages of the dividend yield approach include:\n\nThe focus on dividend yield is incomplete because it ignores capital appreciation.\nThe dividend displacement of earnings concept argues that dividends paid now displace future earnings, which implies a trade-off between current and future cash flows.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929011213448\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderlying earnings are earnings that exclude nonrecurring components.\nThe countercyclical tendency to have high P/Es due to lower EPS at the bottom of the cycle and low P/Es due to high EPS at the top of the cycle is known as the Molodovsky effect.\n\n\n\nimage-20210929011500247\n\n\n\n\n\nNormalized (or normal) earnings per share, which is an estimate of EPS in the middle of the business cycle.\n\nUnder the method of historical average EPS, the normalized EPS is estimated as the average EPS over some recent period, usually the most recent business cycle.\nUnder the method of average return on equity, normalized EPS is estimated as the average return on equity (ROE) multiplied by the current book value per share (BVPS). Once again, average ROE is often measured over the most recent business cycle. The reliance on BVPS reflects the effect of firms size changes more accurately than does the method of historical average EPS.\n\nThe method of historical average EPS ignores size effects, so the method of average ROE is preferred.\n\n\n\n\nNegative earnings render P/E ratios meaningless.\n\n\nA high E/P suggests a cheap security, and a low E/P suggests an expensive security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{Leading\\, P_{0}/E_{1}} = \\frac{D_{1} / E_{1}}{r - g} = \\frac{1 - b}{r - g}\n\\\\\\operatorname{Trailing\\, P_{0}/E_{0}} = \\frac{D_{0} / E_{0} * (1 + g)}{r - g} = \\frac{(1 - b)(1 + g)}{r - g}\n\\\\\\operatorname{Justified\\, P/B} = \\frac{ROE(1 - b)}{r - g} = \\frac{ROE - ROE*b}{r - g} = \\frac{ROE - g}{r - g}\n\\\\\\operatorname{Justified\\, P/S} = \\frac{E_{0} / S_{0}(1 - b)(1 + g)} {r - g} = \\operatorname{profit margin} * \\operatorname{trailing\\, P/E}\n\\\\\\operatorname{Justified\\, P/CF} = \\frac{\\frac{FCFE_{0}(1 + g)}{r - g}}{CF}\n\\\\\\operatorname{Justified\\, EV/EBITDA} = \\frac{\\frac{FCFF_{0}(1 + g)}{WACC - g}}{EBITDA}\n\\\\\\operatorname{Justified\\, D/P} = \\frac{r - g}{1 + g}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929013002675\n\n\nFirms with multiples below the benchmark are undervalued, and firms with multiples above the benchmark are overvalued.\n\n\n\nimage-20210929013009757\n\n\nMost analysts use trailing book values in calculating P/Bs. Relative P/B valuation must consider differences in ROE, risk, and expected growth in making comparisons among stocks.\nP/S ratios are usually calculated based on trailing sales. Analysts need to control for profit margin, expected growth, risk, and the quality of accounting data in making comparisons.\n\n\nThe Fed model considers the overall market to be overvalued (undervalued) when the earnings yield on the S&P 500 Index is lower (higher) than the yield on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds.\nThe Yardeni model includes expected earnings growth rate in the analysis: \\[\n\\\\CEY = CBY - k * LTEG + \\epsilon_{i}\n\\\\CEY = \\text{current earnings yield of the market}\n\\\\CBY = \\text{current Moody's A-rated corporate bond yield}\n\\\\LTEG = \\text{five-year consensus earnings growth rate}\n\\\\k = \\text{constant assigned by the market to earnings growth (about 0.20 in recent years)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\\\\\frac{P}{E} = \\frac{1}{CBY - k * LTEG}\n\\]\nP/E ratio is negatively related to interest rates and positively related to growth.\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{PEG ratio} = \\frac{\\operatorname{P/E\\, ratio}}{g}\n\\]\nThe PEG is interpreted as P/E per unit of expected growth.

US GAAP requires interest paid, interest received, and dividends received to be classified as operating cash flows. IFRS, however, is more flexible: interest paid may be classified as either an operating or financing cash flow, while interest and dividends received can be classified as either operating or investing cash flows.\n\nFree cash flow to equity (FCFE)\n\nTheory suggests that FCFE is the preferred way to define cash flow, but it is more volatile than straight cash flow. \\[\n\\\\FCFE = CFO - FCInv + \\operatorname{net borrowing}\n\\]\n\nEarnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)\n\nEBITDA is a pretax, pre-interest measure that represents a flow to both equity and debt.

Further, benchmarking is difficult because P/Es for individual firms in the same industry vary widely internationally and country market P/Es can vary significantly.\nThe usefulness of all price multiples is affected to some degree by differences in international accounting standards. The lease affected is P/adjusted CFO, P/FCFE, while P/B, P/E, P/EBITDA, and EV/EBITDA will be more seriously affected because they are more influenced by management’s choice of accounting methods and estimates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{earnings surprise} = \\operatorname{reported EPS} - \\operatorname{expected EPS}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{Standardized Unexpected Earnings} = \\frac{\\operatorname{earnings surprise}}{\\operatorname{standard deviation of earnings surprise}}\n\\]\nA given size forecast error is more meaningful the smaller the size of the historical forecast errors.\nRelative strength indicators compare a stock’s price or return performance during a given time period with its own historical performance or with some group of peer stocks.

To see this, recall that with a dividend discount model (DDM) or free cash flow to equity (FCFE) model, a large portion of the estimated intrinsic value comes from the present value of the expected terminal value. Yet the uncertainty of the expected terminal value is usually greater than any of the other forecasted cash flows because it occurs several years in the future. Valuation with residual income models, however, is relatively less sensitive to terminal value estimates, which reduces forecast error.\n주주자본비용 지급 후의 ‘순액’ 개념 (주주자본비용 해당분이 \\(BV_{0}\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\V = B_{0} + \\frac{(ROE - r) * B_{0}}{r - g} = B_{0} + \\frac{RI_{1}}{r - g}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{Tobin's\\, Q} = \\frac{\\operatorname{MV of debt} + \\operatorname{MV of equity}}{\\operatorname{Replacement cost of total assets}} > 1: \\text{economic profit}\n\\]\nFundamental drivers of residual income:\n\nIf return on equity (ROE) is equal to the required return on equity, the justified market value of a share of stock is equal to its book value.

If ROE is greater than the required return on equity, the second term (the present value of residual income) will be positive, the market value will be greater than book value, and the justified P/B ratio will be greater than one.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinuing residual income is the residual income that is expected over the long term.\nThe projected rate at which residual income is expected to fade over the life cycle of the firm is captured by a persistence factor, \\(\\omega\\), which is between zero and one.\n\nResidual income is expected to persist at its current level forever: \\(\\omega = 1\\)\nResidual income is expected to drop immediately to zero: \\(\\omega = 0\\)\nResidual income is expected to decline over time as ROE falls to the cost of equity (in which case residual income is eventually zero.\nResidual income is expected to decline to a long-run average level consistent with a mature industry.\n\nHigher persistence factors will be associated with the following:\n\nLow dividend payouts.\nHistorically high residual income persistence in the industry.\nPO가 낮으면 RR이 높고, g가 높아짐\n\nLower persistence factors will be associated with the following:\n\nHigh return on equity\nSignificant levels of nonrecurring items.\nHigh accounting accruals.\n지나치게 높으면 장기적으로 ROE가 감소\n\n\\[\n\\\\V_{0} = B_{0} + \\operatorname{PV\\, of\\, interim\\, high-growth\\, RI} + \\operatorname{PV of continuing residual income}\n\\\\\\operatorname{PV\\, of\\, continuing\\, residual\\, income\\, in\\, year\\, T-1} = \\frac{RI_{T}}{1 + r - \\omega}\n\\]\n\n\nIf \\(\\omega=1\\) \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{PV\\, of\\, continuing\\, residual\\, income\\, in\\, year\\, T - 1} = \\frac{RI_{T}}{1 + r - \\omega} = \\frac{RI_{T}}{r}\n\\]\n\n\n\nIf \\(\\omega=0\\) \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{PV\\, of\\, coninuing\\, residual\\, income\\, in\\, year\\, T - 1} = \\frac{RI_{T}}{1 + r - \\omega} = \\frac{RI_{T}}{1 + r}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{PV\\, of\\, continuing\\, residual\\, income\\, in\\, year\\, T - 1} = \\frac{RI_{T}}{1 + r - \\omega}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\CRI_{T - 1} = \\frac{RI_{t} + (P_{T} - B_{T})}{1 + r}\n\\\\\\operatorname{PV\\, of\\, continuing\\, residual\\, income\\, in\\, year\\, T} = P_{T} - B_{T}\n\\\\P_{T} = B_{T} * \\operatorname{forecasted\\, price-to-book\\, ratio}\n\\]\nLong-run level에 도달하면 MV - BV가 RI일 것이라는 가정\n\n\n\nimage-20210929125935092\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929125926654\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerminal value does not dominate the intrinsic value estimate, as is the case with dividend discount and free cash flow valuation models.\nResidual income models use accounting data, which is usually easy to find.\nThe models are applicable to firms that do not pay dividends or that do not have positive expected free cash flows in the short run.\nThe models are applicable even when cash flows are volatile.\nThe models focus on economic profitability rather than just on accounting profitability.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe models rely on accounting data that can be manipulated by management.\nReliance on accounting data requires numerous and significant adjustments.\nThe models assume that the clean surplus relation holds or that its failure to hold has been properly taken into account.\n\nResidual income models are appropriate under the following circumstances:\n\nA frim does not pay dividends, or the stream of payments is too volatile to be sufficiently predictabl.e\nExpected free cash flows are negative for the foreseeable future.\nThe terminal value forecast is highly uncertain, which makes dividend discount or free cash flow models less useful.\n\nResidual income models are not appropriate under the following circumstances:\n\nThe clean surplus accounting relation is violated significantly.\nThere is significantly uncertainty concerning the estimates of book value and return on equity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clean surplus relationship (ending book value = beginning book value + net income - dividends) may not hold when items are charged directly to shareholders’ equity and do not go through the income statement.

For example, the allowance for bad debts, which is an offset to accounts receivables, should reflect the expected loss experience.\nInventory for companies that use LIFO should be adjusted to FIFO by adding the LIFO reserve to inventory and equity, assuming no deferred tax impact.\nThe pension asset or liability should be adjusted to reflect the funded status of the plan, which is equal to the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the projected benefit obligations (PBO).\nDeferred tax liabilities should be eliminated and reported as equity if the liability is not expected to reserve.\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo intangible asset require special attention: 1) goodwill and 2) R&D expenditures.\nTo remove distortion, the amortization of intangibles capitalized during acquisition should be removed prior to computing the ROE used for residual income valuation.\nThe suggested analytical treatment of R&D expenditures is less definitive, but we can make the general statement that the ROE estimate for a mature company should reflect the long-term productivity of the company’s R&D expenditures: Productive R&D expenditures increase ROE and residual income, and unproductive expenditure reduce ROE and residual income.\n\n\nNonrecurring items should not be included in residual income forecasts because they represent items that are not expected to continue in the future. Items that may need adjustment in measuring recurring earnings include discounted operations, accounting changes, unusual items, extraordinary items, and restructuring charges. -> RI 계산 시 제외\nFirms may adopt other types of aggressive accounting practices that overstate the book value of assets and earnings.\n\n\n\n\nHow reliable are earning forecasts?\nAre there systematic violations of the clean surplus relation?\nDo poor quality accounting rules result in financial statements that bear no resemblance to the economic reality of the business?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929182136504\n\n\n\n\n\nStage of lifecycle: Private companies are typically less mature than public firms.\nSize: Private firms typically have less capital, fewer assets, and fewer employees than public firms and, as such, can be riskier. Accordingly, private firms are often valued using greater risk premiums and greater required returns compared to public firms.\nQuality and depth of management: Smaller private firms may not be able to attract as many qualified applicants as public firms. This may reduce the depth of management, slow growth, and increase risk at private firm.\nManagement / shareholder overlap: In most private firms, management has a substantial ownership position. In this case, external shareholders have less influence and the firm may be able to take a longer-term perspective.\nShort-term investors: Management of public firm may take a shorter-term view compared to private firms where managers are long-term holders of significant equity interests.\nQuality of financial and other information: A potential creditor or equity investor in a private firm will have less information than is available for a public firm. This leads to greater uncertainty, higher risk, and reduces private firm valuations.\nTaxes: Private firms may be more concerned with taxes than public firms.\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity: Private company equity typically has fewer potential owners and is less liquid than publicly traded equity. Thus, a liquidity discount is often applied in valuing privately held shares.\nRestrictions on marketability: Private companies often have agreements that prevent shareholders from selling, reducing the marketability of shares.\nConcentration of control\n\nOverall, company-specific factors can have positive or negative effects on private company valuations, whereas stock-specific factors are usually a negative. Compared to public companies, private companies haver greater heterogeneity so that the appropriate discount rates and methods for valuing them vary widely as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929183057053\n\n\n\n\n\nVenture capital funding\nInitial public offering (IPO)\nSale in an acquisition\nBankruptcy proceedings\nPerformance-based managerial compensation\n\n\n\n\n\nFinancial reporting: Valuation in this area are often related to goodwill impairment tests in which units of a public firm are valued using private company valuation methods. The reporting of stock-based compensation also required accurate valuation.\nTax purposes: At the firm level, transfer pricing, property taxes, and corporate restructuring may necessitate valuation. For individual equity owners, estate and gift tax issues may necessitate valuations.\n\n\n\n\nLitigation-related valuations may be required for shareholders suits, damage claims, lost profit claims, or divorce settlements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFair market value: tax reporting\n\nA hypothetical willing and able seller sells the asset to a willing and able buyer.\nAn arm’s length transaction (neither party is compelled to act) in a free market.\nA well-informed buyer and seller.\n\nMarket value: real estate and tangible asset appraisal (감정평가)\n\nAn arm’s length transactions.\nA well-informed buyer and seller.\n\nFair value: financial reporting and litigation\nInvestment value: private company sale\n\nA willing seller and buyer\nAn arm’s length transaction\nAn asset that has been marketed.\nA well-informed and prudent buyer and seller\n\nIntrinsic value: Investment analysis\n\nEffects of value definition - value의 정의가 다르면 자산가치가 다르게 산정\n\nintended purpose - 같은 비상장주식이라도 사용목적에 따라 다른 추정치\n대주주의 FMV는 경영권가치 반영, 소액주주의 Investment value는 minority/marketability discount 고려\n세무목적은 FMV, 재무보고 목적은 Fair value\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIncome approach: Values a firm as the present value of its expected future income.\nMarket approach: Values a frim using the price multiples based on recent sales of comparable assets.\nAsset-based approach: Values a firm’s assets minus its liabilities.\n\nEarly in its life, a firm’s future cash flows may be subject to so much uncertainty that an asset-based approach would be most appropriate. As the firm moves to a high growth phase, it might be appropriately valued using an income approach. A mature firm might be more appropriately valued using the market approach.\nFirm size is also a consideration in choosing a valuation methodology. Price multiples from large public firms should not be used to value a small private firm without some assurance that the risk and growth prospects of the firms are similar.\nNonoperating assets constitute a portion of firm value and must be included when valuing a firm.\n\n\n\nIn valuing a firm, the appropriate earnings definition is normalized earnings: “firm earnings if the firm were acquired.”\n\n\nNormalized earnings should exclude nonrecurring and unusual items. In the case of private firms with a concentrated control, there may be discretionary or tax-motivated expenses that need to be adjusted when calculating normalized earnings.\nArtificially low earnings may also be the result of excessively high owner compensation or of personal expenses charged to the firm. Use of company-owned assets potentially require an adjustment to earnings.\nAny real estate owned by the firm may merit treatment separate from that of firm operations for the following reasons:\n\nThe real estate may have different risk characteristics than firm operations.\nThe real estate may have different growth prospects than firm operations.\nDepreciation is most often based on historical cost and may understate the current cost in the market of the use of the assets.\n\nIf it is used in the firm’s business, a market-estimated rental expense is used in calculating or estimating earnings. The value of real estate is therefore separated from its operations and treated as a nonoperating asset. If the real estate is leased from a related party, the lease rate should be adjusted to a market rate.\nOther adjustments are common to both private and public companies. Additionally, some private firm financial statements are reviewed rather than audited; In any case, the analyst should be prepared to make further adjustments.\n\n\n\nIn a strategic transaction, valuation of the firm is based in part on the perceived synergies with the acquirer’s other assets. A financial transaction assumes no synergies, as when one firm buys another in a dissimilar industry.\n\n\n\nAlso, controlling and noncontrolling equity interests will have quite different values. These differences should be accounted for in cash flow estimates and assumptions.\nWhen there is significant uncertainty about a private company’s future operations, the analyst should examine several scenarios when estimating future cash flows. For development stage firms, scenarios could include a sale of the firm, an IPO, bankruptcy, or continued private operation. For a mature firm, scenarios might include different ranges of cash flows based on different assumed growth rates.\nThe analyst should be aware of the potential bias in management estimates. For example, management may overstate the value of goodwill or understate future capital needs.\nAlthough analysts use FCFF or FCFE depending on the purposes of the valuation, FCFF is usually more appropriate when the significant changes in the firm’s capital structure are anticipated. The reasoning is that the discount rate used for FCFF valuation, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), is less sensitive to leverage changes than the cost of equity, the discount rate used for FCFE valuation.\n\n\n\nimage-20210929185438842\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe free cash flow method here is a two-stage model.\n\n\n\nUnder this method, a single measure of economic benefit is divided by a capitalization rate to arrive at firm value, where the capitalization rate is the required rate of return minus a growth rate. This is a growing perpetuity model that assumes stable growth and is, in effect, a single-stage free cash flow model. It is most often used for small private companies. It may be suitable when no comparables are available, projections are quire uncertain, and stable growth is a reasonable assumption.\nIf growth is non-constant, the capitalized cash flow method (CCM) should be avoided in favor of the free cash flow method. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{value of a firm} = \\frac{FCFF_{1}}{WACC - g}\n\\\\\\operatorname{value of equity} = \\frac{FCFE_{1}}{r - g}\n\\]\n\n\n\nExcess earnings are firm earnings minus the earnings required to provide the required rate of return on working capital and fixed assets. The value of intangible asset can be estimated as the present value of the (growing) stream of excess earnings (using the excess earnings and the growing perpetuity formula from the CCM). This value for the intangible assets is added to the values of working capital and fixed assets to arrive at firm value.\nThe excess earnings method (EEM) is used infrequently but can be used for small firms when their intangible assets are significant. However, the required return for working capital and fixed assets is subject to estimation error. \\[\n\\\\\\\\\\\\operatorname{firm value} = \\operatorname{value\\, of\\, FC\\, / WC (tangible)} + \\operatorname{PV\\, of\\, future\\, excess\\, earning\\, (Intangible)}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nSize premiums: Size premiums are often added to the discount rates for small private companies.\nAvailability and cost of debt: A private firm may have less access to debt financing than a public firm. Because equity capital is usually more expensive than debt and because the higher operating risk of smaller private companies results in higher cost of debt as well. WACC will typically be higher for private firms.\nAcquirer versus target: When acquiring a private firm, some acquirer will incorrectly use their own (lower) cost of capital, rather than the higher rate appropriate for the target, and arrive at a value of the target company that is too high.\nProjection risk: Because of the lower availability of information from private firms and managers who are inexperienced at forecasting, that analysts should increase the discount rate used.\nLifecycle stage: It is particularly difficult to estimate the discount rate for firms in an early stage of development. If such firms have unusually high levels of unsystematic risk, the use of the CAPM may be inappropriate.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929191029630\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAPM: Typically, beta is estimated from public firm data, and this may not be appropriate for private firms that have little change of going public or being acquired by a public firm.\nExpanded CAPM: This version of the CAPM includes additional premiums for size and firm-specific (unsystematic) risk.\nBuild-up method: When it is not possible to find comparable public firms for beta estimation, the build-up method can be used. Beginning with the expected return on the market (beta is implicitly assumed to be one), premiums are added for small size, industry factors, and company specific factors.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929191347008\n\n\n\n\n\nMarket approaches to valuing private firms use price multiples and data from previous public and private transactions.\n\nlarge private firm: EBIT or EBITDA multiple\nsmall private firm: NI multiple\nExtremely small private firm: Revenue multiple\n\n\n\n\nimage-20210929191604234\n\n\n\n\nThe guideline public company method (GPCM) uses price multiples from trade data for public companies, with adjustments to the multiples to account for differences between the subject firm and the comparables.\nWhen evaluating a controlling equity interest in a private firm, the control premium should be estimated. Most public share trades are for small, noncontrolling interests; therefore, the price multiple does not reflect a control premium.\nWhen estimating a control premium, the following issues should be considered:\n\nTransaction type: strategic or financial (nonstrategic). A financial transactions typically has a smaller price premium.\nIndustry conditions: Periodically, there is a flurry in industry acquisition activity, diving up acquisition prices. In such markets, share prices of public companies may already reflect some premium for control, and adding a standard control premium to such share price may overstate the appropriate premium for control.\nType of consideration: Some historical acquisitions involves the acquirer’s stock rather than cash. Estimates of the control premium when acquisitions are made up shares that are at higher temporary or “bubble” values will be overstated.\nReasonableness: The use of control premium and price multiples can quickly result in significant differences in valuation from historical pricing.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the guideline transactions method (GTM), prior acquisition values for entire (public and private) companies that already reflect any control premiums are used, so no additional adjustment for a controlling interest is necessary.\n\nTransaction type\nContingent consideration: Contingent consideration refers to that part of the acquisition price that is contingent on the achievement of specific company performance targets, such as receiving FDA approval for a drug.\nType of consideration\nAvailability of data\nDate of data\n\n\n\nThe prior transaction method (PTM) uses transactions data from the stock of the actual subject company and is most appropriate when valuing minority (noncontrolling) interests.\nIdeally, the previous transactions would be arm’s-length, of the same motivation (strategic or financial) as the subject transaction, and fairly recent.\n\n\n\n\nThe value of ownership is equivalent to the fair value of its assets less the fair value of its liabilities.\nRarely used for going concerns: difficulty in valuing intangible assets.\nMost appropriate for:\n\nResource firms\nFinancial service firms, investment companies (real estate investment trusts, closed-end investment companies)\nsmall business with limited intangible assets or early stage companies\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMinority shareholders are at a disadvantage relative to controlling shareholders because they have less power to select the directors and management. They cannot determine the investment and payout policies that affect the value of the firm and the distribution of earnings.\nControlling shareholders can also enjoy excessive compensation and other perquisites to the detriment of minority shareholders. \\[\n\\\\DLOC = 1 - \\frac{1}{1 + \\operatorname{control premium}}\n\\\\DLOC = \\text{Discount Lack of Control}\n\\] \n\n\n\nIf an interest in a firm cannot be easily sold, discounts for lack of marketability (DLOM) would be applied (sometimes termed a discount for lack of liquidity). It is often the case that if a DLOC is applied.\nThe DLOM varies with the following:\n\nAn impending IPO or firm sale would decrease the DLOM.\nThe payment of dividends would decrease the DLOM.\nEarlier, higher payments would decrease the DLOM.\nContractual restrictions on selling stock would increase the DLOM.\nA greater pool of buyers would decrease the DLOM.\nGreater risk and value uncertainty would increase the DLOM.\n\nTo estimate the DLOM, an analyst can use one of three methods. The price of the restricted shares is compared to the price of the publicly traded shares.\nA third method would estimate the DLOM as the price of a put option divided by the stock price. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{total discount} = 1 - (1 - DLOC)(1 - DLOM)\n\\]\n\n\n\nimage-20210929193918102\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Uniform Standards of Professional Appraisal Practice (USPAP) were created by the Appraisal Foundation.\nThe International Valuation Standards Committee (IVSC) has create the International Valuation Standards.\nThere are many challenges involved with the implementation of appraisal standards:\n\nThe compliance with these standards is usually at the discretion of the appraiser because most buyers are still unaware of them.\nBecause most valuation reports are private, it is very difficult for the organizations to ensure compliance to the standards.\nAlthough the organizations provide technical guidance on the use of their standards, it is necessarily limited due to the heterogeneity of valuations."

It can simulate a complete system with devices and an operating system in full system mode (FS mode), or user space only programs where system services are provided directly by the simulator in syscall emulation mode (SE mode).\nThere are varying levels of support for executing Alpha, ARM, MIPS, Power, SPARC, RISC-V, and 64 bit x86 binaries on CPU models including two simple single CPI models, an out of order model, and an in order pipelined model.\nA memory system can be flexibly built out of caches and crossbars or the Ruby simulator which provides even more flexible memory system modeling.\n\n\nLab’s objectives\ngem5 introduction\ngem5 installation step-by-step\n\n\nInstalling Windows subsystem for Linux\ngem5 must be built on a Unix platform. Linux is tested on every commit, and some people have been able to use MacOS as well, though it is not regularly tested.\nWindows Subsystem for Linux allows you to use Ubuntu Terminal and run Ubuntu command line utilize including bash, ssh, git, apt, and many more.\nHowever, it is strongly suggested to not try to compile gem5 when running on a virtual machine. When running with a VM on a laptop gem5 can take over an hour just to compile.\nIf you want to run distros of Linux on Windows 10, you must first enable the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) feature before you can download and install the flavor of Linux that you want to use.\nInstalling WSL using setting on Windows 10, use these steps:\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\nBuilding gem5\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\nRunning your benchmark on gem5\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\n\nUntitled\n\n\n\n\nMotivation for Serial communication\nConnect different systems together\n\ntwo embedded systems\na desktop and an embedded system\n\nConnect different chips together in the same embedded system\n\nMCU to peripheral\nMCU to MCU\n\nWithout using a lot of I/O lines\n\nI/O lines require I/O pads which cost and size\nI/O lines requires PCB area which costs and size\nOften at relatively low data rates"

    "text": "These technologies have the potential to harm or help the people that they serve. By applying an ethical lens, we can work toward identifying the harms that these technologies can cause to people and we can design and build them to reduce these harms - or decide not to build them.\nThis course covers several topics:\n\nIn the human-centered design lesson, you’ll learn how to design an AI system to ensure that it serves the needs of the people that it is intended for.\nIn the bias lesson, you’ll determine how AI systems can learn to discriminate against certain groups.\nIn the fairness lesson, you’ll learn to quantify the extent of the bias in AI systems.\nIn the model cards lesson, you’ll learn how to use a popular framework for improving public accountability for AI models.\n\n\n\nBefore selecting data and training models, it is important to carefully consider the human needs an AI system should serve - and if it should be built at all.\nHuman-centered design (HCD) is an approach to designing systems that serve people’s needs.\n6 steps\n\n\nYour entire team – including data scientists and engineers – should be involved in this step, so that every team member gains an understanding of the people they hope to serve. Your team should include and involve people with diverse perspectives and backgrounds, along race, gender, and other characteristics. Sharpen your problem definition and brainstorm creative and inclusive solutions together.\n\n\n\n\nWould people generally agree that what you are trying to achieve is a good outcome?\nWould non-AI systems - such as rule-based solutions, which are easier to create, audit and maintain - be significantly less effective than an AI system?\nIs the task that you are using AI for one that people would find boring, repetitive or otherwise difficult to concentrate on?\nHave AI solutions proven to be better than other solutions for similar use cases in the past?\n\nIf you answered no to any of these questions, an AI solution may not be necessary or appropriate.\n\n\n\nWeigh the benefits of using AI against the potential harms, throughout the design pipeline: from collecting and labeling data, to training a model, to deploying the AI system. Consider the impact on users and on society. Your privacy team can help uncover hidden privacy issues and determine whether privacy-preserving techniques like differential privacy or federated learning may be appropriate. Take steps to reduce harms, including by embedding people - and therefore human judgment - more effectively in data selection, in model training and in the operation of the system. If you estimate that the harms are likely to outweigh the benefits, do not build the system.\n\n\nAn online education company wants to use an AI system to ‘read’ and automatically assign scores to student essays, while redirecting company staff to double-check random essays and to review essays that the AI system has trouble with. The system would enable the company to quickly get scores back to students. The company creates a harms review committee, which recommends that the system not be built. Some of the major harms flagged by the committee include: the potential for the AI system to pick up bias against certain patterns of language from training data and amplify it (harming people in the groups that use those patterns of language), to encourage students to ‘game’ the algorithm rather than improve their essays and to reduce the classroom role of education experts while increasing the role of technology experts.\n\n\n\n\nDevelop a non-AI prototype of your AI system quickly to see how people interact with it. This makes prototyping easier, faster and less expensive. It also gives you early information about what users expect from your system and how to make their interactions more rewarding and meaningful.\nThe people giving feedback should have diverse backgrounds – including along race, gender, expertise and other characteristics. They should also understand and consent to what they are helping with and how.\n\n\n\nPeople who use your AI system once it is live should be able to challenge its recommendations or easily opt out of using it. Put systems and tools in place to accept, monitor and address challenges.\nTalk to users and think from the perspective of a user: if you are curious or dissatisfied with the system’s recommendations, would you want to challenge it by:\n\nRequesting an explanation of how it arrived at its recommendation?\nRequesting a change in the information you input?\nTurning off certain features?\nReaching out to the product team on social media?\nTaking some other action?\n\n\n\n\nSafety measures protect users against harm. They seek to limit unintended behavior and accidents, by ensuring that a system reliably delivers high-quality outcomes. This can only be achieved through extensive and continuous evaluation and testing. Design processes around your AI system to continuously monitor performance, delivery of intended benefits, reduction of harms, fairness metrics and any changes in how people are actually using it.\nHuman oversight of your AI system is crucial:\n\nCreate a human ‘red team’ to play the role of a person trying to manipulate your system into unintended behavior. Then, strengthen your system against any such manipulation.\nDetermine how people in your organization can best monitor the system’s safety once it is live.\nExplore ways for your AI system to quickly alert a human when it is faced with a challenging case.\nCreate ways for users and others to flag potential safety issues.\n\n\n\n\n\nML applications have discriminated against individuals on the basis of race, sex, religion, socioeconomic status, and other categories.\n\n\nBias in data is complex. Flawed data can also result in representation bias (covered later in this tutorial), if a group is underrepresented in the training data. For instance, when training a facial detection system, if the training data contains mostly individuals with lighter skin tones, it will fail to perform well for users with darker skin tones. A third type of bias that can arise from the training data is called measurement bias, which you’ll learn about below.\nbias can also result from the way in which the ML model is defined, from the way the model is compared to other models, and from the way that everyday users interpret the final results of the model. Harm can come from anywhere in the ML process.\n\n\n\n\n\nHistorical bias occurs when the state of the world in which the data was generated is flawed.\n\n\n\nMeasurement bias occurs when the accuracy of the data varies across groups. This can happen when working with proxy variables (variables that take the place of a variable that cannot be directly measured), if the quality of the proxy varies in different groups.\n\n\n\nAggregation bias occurs when groups are inappropriately combined, resulting in a model that does not perform well for any group or only performs well for the majority group. (This is often not an issue, but most commonly arises in medical applications.)\n\n\n\nEvaluation bias occurs when evaluating a model, if the benchmark data (used to compare the model to other models that perform similar tasks) does not represent the population that the model will serve.\n\n\n\nDeployment bias occurs when the problem the model is intended to solve is different from the way it is actually used. If the end users don’t use the model in the way it is intended, there is no guarantee that the model will perform well.\nNote that these are not mutually exclusive: that is, an ML application can easily suffer from more than one type of bias.\n\n\n\nimage-20211002021354944\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002021457078\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002021549954\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemographic parity says the model is fair if the composition of people who are selected by the model matches the group membership percentages of the applicants.\n\nA nonprofit is organizing an international conference, and 20,000 people have signed up to attend. The organizers write a ML model to select 100 attendees who could potentially give interesting talks at the conference. Since 50% of the attendees will be women (10,000 out of 20,000), they design the model so that 50% of the selected speaker candidates are women.\n\n\n\n\nEqual opportunity fairness ensures that the proportion of people who should be selected by the model (“positives”) that are correctly selected by the model is the same for each group. We refer to this proportion as the true positive rate (TPR) or sensitivity of the model.\n\n\n\nAlternatively, we could check that the model has equal accuracy for each group. That is, the percentage of correct classifications (people who should be denied and are denied, and people who should be approved who are approved) should be the same for each group.\n\n\n\nGroup unaware fairness removes all group membership information from the dataset. For instance, we can remove gender data to try to make the model fair to different gender groups. Similarly, we can remove information about race or age.\n\nOne difficulty of applying this approach in practice is that one has to be careful to identify and remove proxies for the group membership data. For instance, in cities that are racially segregated, zip code is a strong proxy for race. That is, when the race data is removed, the zip code data should also be removed, or else the ML application may still be able to infer an individual’s race from the data. Additionally, group unaware fairness is unlikely to be a good solution for historical bias.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimg\n\n\nNote that *group unaware* fairness cannot be detected from the confusion matrix, and is more concerned with removing group membership information from the dataset.\nAlso note that none of the examples satisfy more than one type of fairness. For instance, the demographic parity example does not satisfy equal accuracy or equal opportunity. Take the time to verify this now. In practice, it is not possible to optimize a model for more than one type of fairness: to read more about this, explore the Impossibility Theorem of Machine Fairness. So which fairness criterion should you select, if you can only satisfy one? As with most ethical questions, the correct answer is usually not straightforward, and picking a criterion should be a long conversation involving everyone on your team.\nWhen working with a real project, the data will be much, much larger. In this case, confusion matrices are still a useful tool for analyzing model performance. One important thing to note, however, is that real-world models typically cannot be expected to satisfy any fairness definition perfectly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002023258614\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002023452065\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211002023622243\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA model card is a short document that provides key information about a machine learning model. Model cards increase transparency by communicating information about trained models to broad audiences.\nAI researchers are exploring many ways to communicate key information about models to inform people who use AI systems, people who are affected by AI systems and others.\nModel cards - introduced in a 2019 paper - are one way for teams to communicate key information about their AI system to a broad audience. This information generally includes intended uses for the model, how the model works, and how the model performs in different situations.\n\n\nA model card should strike a balance between being easy-to-understand and communicating important technical information. When writing a model card, you should consider your audience: the groups of people who are most likely to read your model card. These groups will vary according to the AI system’s purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInclude background information, such as developer and model version.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat use cases are in scope?\nWho are your intended users?\nWhat use cases are out of scope?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat factors affect the impact of the model?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat metrics are you using to measure the performance of the model? Why did you pick those metrics?\n\nFor classification systems – in which the output is a class label – potential error types include false positive rate, false negative rate, false discovery rate, and false omission rate. The relative importance of each of these depends on the use case.\nFor score-based analyses – in which the output is a score or price – consider reporting model performance across groups.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich datasets did you use to evaluate model performance? Provide the datasets if you can.\nWhy did you choose these datasets for evaluation?\nAre the datasets representative of typical use cases, anticipated test cases and/or challenging cases?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhich data was the model trained on?\n\n\n\n\n\nHow did the model perform on the metrics you chose? Break down performance by important factors and their intersections.\n\n\n\n\n\nDescribe ethical considerations related to the model, such as sensitive data used to train the model, whether the model has implications for human life, health, or safety, how risk was mitigated, and what harms may be present in model usage.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdd anything important that you have not covered elsewhere in the model card.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe use of detailed model cards can often be challenging because an organization may not want to reveal its processes, proprietary data or trade secrets. In such cases, the developer team should think about how model cards can be useful and empowering, without including sensitive information.\n\n\n\n\nTo dive deeper into the application of HCD to AI, check out these resources:\n\nLex Fridman’s introductory lecture on Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence\nGoogle’s People + AI Research (PAIR) Guidebook\nStanford Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence (HAI) research\n\nTo continue learning about bias, check out the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification competition that was introduced in this exercise.\n\nKaggler Dieter has written a helpful two-part series that teaches you how to preprocess the data and train a neural network to make a competition submission. Get started here.\nMany Kagglers have written helpful notebooks that you can use to get started. Check them out on the competition page.\n\nAnother Kaggle competition that you can use to learn about bias is the Inclusive Images Challenge, which you can read more about in this blog post. The competition focuses on evaluation bias in computer vision.\n\nExplore different types of fairness with an interactive tool.\nYou can read more about equal opportunity in this blog post.\nAnalyze ML fairness with this walkthrough of the What-If Tool, created by the People and AI Research (PAIR) team at Google. This tool allows you to quickly amend an ML model, once you’ve picked the fairness criterion that is best for your use case."

    "text": "Using Keras and Tensorflow you’ll learn how to:\n\ncreate a fully-connected neural network architecture\napply neural nets to two classic ML problems: regression and classification\ntrain neural nets with stochastic gradient descent, and\nimprove performance with dropout, batch normalization, and other techniques\n\n\n\nDeep learning is an approach to machine learning characterized by deep stacks of computations. This depth of computation is what has enabled deep learning models to disentangle the kinds of complex and hierarchical patterns found in the most challenging real-world datasets.\nThrough their power and scalability neural networks have become the defining model of deep learning. Neural networks are composed of neurons, where each neuron individually performs only a simple computation. The power of a neural network comes instead from the complexity of the connections these neurons can form.\n\n\n\nAs a diagram, a neuron (or unit) with one input looks like:\n\n\n\nDiagram of a linear unit.\n\n\nThe input is x. Its connection to the neuron has a weight which is w. Whenever a value flows through a connection, you multiply the value by the connection’s weight. For the input x, what reaches the neuron is w * x. A neural network “learns” by modifying its weights.\nThe b is a special kind of weight we call the bias. The bias doesn’t have any input data associated with it; instead, we put a 1 in the diagram so that the value that reaches the neuron is just b (since 1 * b = b). The bias enables the neuron to modify the output independently of its inputs.\nThe y is the value the neuron ultimately outputs. To get the output, the neuron sums up all the values it receives through its connections. This neuron’s activation is y = w * x + b, or as a formula \\(y=wx+b\\).\nThough individual neurons will usually only function as part of a larger network, it’s often useful to start with a single neuron model as a baseline. Single neuron models are linear models.\n\n\n\nComputing with the linear unit.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can just add more input connections to the neuron, one for each additional feature. To find the output, we would multiply each input to its connection weight and then add them all together.\n\n\n\nThree input connections: x0, x1, and x2, along with the bias.\n\n\nThe formula for this neuron would be \\(y=w_{0}x_{0}+w_{1}x_{1}+w_{2}x_{2}+b\\). A linear unit with two inputs will fit a plane, and a unit with more inputs than that will fit a hyperplane.\n\n\n\nThe easiest way to create a model in Keras is through keras.Sequential, which creates a neural network as a stack of layers. We can create models like those above using a dense layer (which we’ll learn more about in the next lesson).\nWe could define a linear model accepting three input features ('sugars', 'fiber', and 'protein') and producing a single output ('calories') like so:\n\n\n\nimage-20211006183116710\n\n\nWith the first argument, units, we define how many outputs we want. In this case we are just predicting 'calories', so we’ll use units=1.\nWith the second argument, input_shape, we tell Keras the dimensions of the inputs. Setting input_shape=[3] ensures the model will accept three features as input ('sugars', 'fiber', and 'protein').\nWhy is input_shape a Python list? The data we’ll use in this course will be tabular data, like in a Pandas dataframe. We’ll have one input for each feature in the dataset. The features are arranged by column, so we’ll always have input_shape=[num_columns]. The reason Keras uses a list here is to permit use of more complex datasets. Image data, for instance, might need three dimensions: [height, width, channels].\n\n\n\n\nIn this lesson we’re going to see how we can build neural networks capable of learning the complex kinds of relationships deep neural nets are famous for.\nThe key idea here is modularity, building up a complex network from simpler functional units. We’ve seen how a linear unit computes a linear function – now we’ll see how to combine and modify these single units to model more complex relationships.\n\n\nNeural networks typically organize their neurons into layers. When we collect together linear units having a common set of inputs we get a dense layer.\n\n\n\nA stack of three circles in an input layer connected to two circles in a dense layer.\n\n\nYou could think of each layer in a neural network as performing some kind of relatively simple transformation. Through a deep stack of layers, a neural network can transform its inputs in more and more complex ways. In a well-trained neural network, each layer is a transformation getting us a little bit closer to a solution.\nMany Kinds of Layers A “layer” in Keras is a very general kind of thing. A layer can be, essentially, any kind of data transformation. Many layers, like the convolutional and recurrent layers, transform data through use of neurons and differ primarily in the pattern of connections they form. Others though are used for feature engineering or just simple arithmetic. There’s a whole world of layers to discover – check them out!\n\n\n\nIt turns out, however, that two dense layers with nothing in between are no better than a single dense layer by itself. Dense layers by themselves can never move us out of the world of lines and planes. What we need is something nonlinear. What we need are activation functions.\nWithout activation functions, neural networks can only learn linear relationships. In order to fit curves, we’ll need to use activation functions.\nAn activation function is simply some function we apply to each of a layer’s outputs (its activations). The most common is the rectifier function max(0,x)max(0,x).\n\n\n\nA graph of the rectifier function. The line y=x when x>0 and y=0 when x<0, making a ‘hinge’ shape like ’_/’.\n\n\nThe rectifier function has a graph that’s a line with the negative part “rectified” to zero. Applying the function to the outputs of a neuron will put a bend in the data, moving us away from simple lines.\nWhen we attach the rectifier to a linear unit, we get a rectified linear unit or ReLU. (For this reason, it’s common to call the rectifier function the “ReLU function”.) Applying a ReLU activation to a linear unit means the output becomes max(0, w * x + b), which we might draw in a diagram like:\n\n\n\nDiagram of a single ReLU. Like a linear unit, but instead of a ‘+’ symbol we now have a hinge ’_/’.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow that we have some nonlinearity, let’s see how we can stack layers to get complex data transformations.\n\n\n\nAn input layer, two hidden layers, and a final linear layer.\n\n\nThe layers before the output layer are sometimes called hidden since we never see their outputs directly.\nNow, notice that the final (output) layer is a linear unit (meaning, no activation function). That makes this network appropriate to a regression task, where we are trying to predict some arbitrary numeric value. Other tasks (like classification) might require an activation function on the output.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006184240869\n\n\nBe sure to pass all the layers together in a list, like [layer, layer, layer, ...], instead of as separate arguments. To add an activation function to a layer, just give its name in the activation argument.\n\n\n\n\nAs with all machine learning tasks, we begin with a set of training data. Each example in the training data consists of some features (the inputs) together with an expected target (the output). Training the network means adjusting its weights in such a way that it can transform the features into the target. In the 80 Cereals dataset, for instance, we want a network that can take each cereal’s 'sugar', 'fiber', and 'protein' content and produce a prediction for that cereal’s 'calories'. If we can successfully train a network to do that, its weights must represent in some way the relationship between those features and that target as expressed in the training data.\nIn addition to the training data, we need two more things:\n\nA “loss function” that measures how good the network’s predictions are.\nAn “optimizer” that can tell the network how to change its weights.\n\n\n\nWe’ve seen how to design an architecture for a network, but we haven’t seen how to tell a network what problem to solve. This is the job of the loss function.\nThe loss function measures the disparity between the the target’s true value and the value the model predicts.\nDifferent problems call for different loss functions. We have been looking at regression problems, where the task is to predict some numerical value – calories in 80 Cereals, rating in Red Wine Quality. Other regression tasks might be predicting the price of a house or the fuel efficiency of a car.\nA common loss function for regression problems is the mean absolute error or MAE. For each prediction y_pred, MAE measures the disparity from the true target y_true by an absolute difference abs(y_true - y_pred).\nThe total MAE loss on a dataset is the mean of all these absolute differences.\n\n\n\nA graph depicting error bars from data points to the fitted line..\n\n\nBesides MAE, other loss functions you might see for regression problems are the mean-squared error (MSE) or the Huber loss (both available in Keras).\nDuring training, the model will use the loss function as a guide for finding the correct values of its weights (lower loss is better). In other words, the loss function tells the network its objective.\n\n\n\nWe’ve described the problem we want the network to solve, but now we need to say how to solve it. This is the job of the optimizer. The optimizer is an algorithm that adjusts the weights to minimize the loss.\nVirtually all of the optimization algorithms used in deep learning belong to a family called stochastic gradient descent. They are iterative algorithms that train a network in steps. One step of training goes like this:\n\nSample some training data and run it through the network to make predictions.\nMeasure the loss between the predictions and the true values.\nFinally, adjust the weights in a direction that makes the loss smaller.\n\nThen just do this over and over until the loss is as small as you like (or until it won’t decrease any further.)\n\n\n\nFitting a line batch by batch. The loss decreases and the weights approach their true values.\n\n\nEach iteration’s sample of training data is called a minibatch (or often just “batch”), while a complete round of the training data is called an epoch. The number of epochs you train for is how many times the network will see each training example.\n\n\n\nNotice that the line only makes a small shift in the direction of each batch (instead of moving all the way). The size of these shifts is determined by the learning rate. A smaller learning rate means the network needs to see more minibatches before its weights converge to their best values.\nThe learning rate and the size of the minibatches are the two parameters that have the largest effect on how the SGD training proceeds. Their interaction is often subtle and the right choice for these parameters isn’t always obvious.\nFortunately, for most work it won’t be necessary to do an extensive hyperparameter search to get satisfactory results. Adam is an SGD algorithm that has an adaptive learning rate that makes it suitable for most problems without any parameter tuning (it is “self tuning”, in a sense). Adam is a great general-purpose optimizer.\n\n\n\nAfter defining a model, you can add a loss function and optimizer with the model’s compile method:\nmodel.compile(\n    optimizer=\"adam\",\n    loss=\"mae\",\n)\nNotice that we are able to specify the loss and optimizer with just a string. You can also access these directly through the Keras API – if you wanted to tune parameters, for instance – but for us, the defaults will work fine.\nWhat’s In a Name? The gradient is a vector that tells us in what direction the weights need to go. More precisely, it tells us how to change the weights to make the loss change fastest. We call our process gradient descent because it uses the gradient to descend the loss curve towards a minimum. Stochastic means “determined by chance.” Our training is stochastic because the minibatches are random samples from the dataset. And that’s why it’s called SGD!\nOne thing you might note for now though is that we’ve rescaled each feature to lie in the interval [0,1][0,1]. As we’ll discuss more in Lesson 5, neural networks tend to perform best when their inputs are on a common scale.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006185813175\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006185829299\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006190149421\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006190231572\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this lesson, we’re going to learn how to interpret these learning curves and how we can use them to guide model development. In particular, we’ll examine at the learning curves for evidence of underfitting and overfitting and look at a couple of strategies for correcting it.\n\n\nYou might think about the information in the training data as being of two kinds: signal and noise. The signal is the part that generalizes, the part that can help our model make predictions from new data. The noise is that part that is only true of the training data; the noise is all of the random fluctuation that comes from data in the real-world or all of the incidental, non-informative patterns that can’t actually help the model make predictions. The noise is the part might look useful but really isn’t.\nWe train a model by choosing weights or parameters that minimize the loss on a training set. You might know, however, that to accurately assess a model’s performance, we need to evaluate it on a new set of data, the validation data.\nWhen we train a model we’ve been plotting the loss on the training set epoch by epoch. To this we’ll add a plot the validation data too. These plots we call the learning curves. To train deep learning models effectively, we need to be able to interpret them.\n\n\n\nA graph of training and validation loss.\n\n\nNow, the training loss will go down either when the model learns signal or when it learns noise. But the validation loss will go down only when the model learns signal. (Whatever noise the model learned from the training set won’t generalize to new data.) So, when a model learns signal both curves go down, but when it learns noise a gap is created in the curves. The size of the gap tells you how much noise the model has learned.\nIdeally, we would create models that learn all of the signal and none of the noise. This will practically never happen. Instead we make a trade. We can get the model to learn more signal at the cost of learning more noise. So long as the trade is in our favor, the validation loss will continue to decrease. After a certain point, however, the trade can turn against us, the cost exceeds the benefit, and the validation loss begins to rise.\n\n\n\nTwo graphs. On the left, a line through a few data points with the true fit a parabola. On the right, a curve running through each datapoint with the true fit a parabola.\n\n\nThis trade-off indicates that there can be two problems that occur when training a model: not enough signal or too much noise. Underfitting the training set is when the loss is not as low as it could be because the model hasn’t learned enough signal. Overfitting the training set is when the loss is not as low as it could be because the model learned too much noise. The trick to training deep learning models is finding the best balance between the two.\n\n\n\nA model’s capacity refers to the size and complexity of the patterns it is able to learn. For neural networks, this will largely be determined by how many neurons it has and how they are connected together. If it appears that your network is underfitting the data, you should try increasing its capacity.\nYou can increase the capacity of a network either by making it wider (more units to existing layers) or by making it deeper (adding more layers). Wider networks have an easier time learning more linear relationships, while deeper networks prefer more nonlinear ones.\n\n\n\nWe mentioned that when a model is too eagerly learning noise, the validation loss may start to increase during training. To prevent this, we can simply stop the training whenever it seems the validation loss isn’t decreasing anymore. Interrupting the training this way is called early stopping.\n\n\n\nA graph of the learning curves with early stopping at the minimum validation loss, underfitting to the left of it and overfitting to the right.\n\n\nOnce we detect that the validation loss is starting to rise again, we can reset the weights back to where the minimum occured. This ensures that the model won’t continue to learn noise and overfit the data.\nTraining with early stopping also means we’re in less danger of stopping the training too early, before the network has finished learning signal. So besides preventing overfitting from training too long, early stopping can also prevent underfitting from not training long enough. Just set your training epochs to some large number (more than you’ll need), and early stopping will take care of the rest.\n\n\n\nIn Keras, we include early stopping in our training through a callback. A callback is just a function you want run every so often while the network trains. The early stopping callback will run after every epoch. (Keras has a variety of useful callbacks pre-defined, but you can define your own, too.)\n\n\n\nimage-20211006191222318\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211006191311344\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere’s more to the world of deep learning than just dense layers. There are dozens of kinds of layers you might add to a model. (Try browsing through the Keras docs for a sample!) Some are like dense layers and define connections between neurons, and others can do preprocessing or transformations of other sorts.\nIn this lesson, we’ll learn about a two kinds of special layers, not containing any neurons themselves, but that add some functionality that can sometimes benefit a model in various ways. Both are commonly used in modern architectures.\n\n\nThe first of these is the “dropout layer”, which can help correct overfitting.\nIn the last lesson we talked about how overfitting is caused by the network learning spurious patterns in the training data. To recognize these spurious patterns a network will often rely on very a specific combinations of weight, a kind of “conspiracy” of weights. Being so specific, they tend to be fragile: remove one and the conspiracy falls apart.\nThis is the idea behind dropout. To break up these conspiracies, we randomly drop out some fraction of a layer’s input units every step of training, making it much harder for the network to learn those spurious patterns in the training data. Instead, it has to search for broad, general patterns, whose weight patterns tend to be more robust.\n\n\n\nAn animation of a network cycling through various random dropout configurations.\n\n\nYou could also think about dropout as creating a kind of ensemble of networks. The predictions will no longer be made by one big network, but instead by a committee of smaller networks. Individuals in the committee tend to make different kinds of mistakes, but be right at the same time, making the committee as a whole better than any individual. (If you’re familiar with random forests as an ensemble of decision trees, it’s the same idea.)\nkeras.Sequential([\n    # ...\n    layers.Dropout(rate=0.3), # apply 30% dropout to the next layer\n    layers.Dense(16),\n    # ...\n])\n\n\n\nThe next special layer we’ll look at performs “batch normalization” (or “batchnorm”), which can help correct training that is slow or unstable.\nWith neural networks, it’s generally a good idea to put all of your data on a common scale, perhaps with something like scikit-learn’s StandardScaler or MinMaxScaler. The reason is that SGD will shift the network weights in proportion to how large an activation the data produces. Features that tend to produce activations of very different sizes can make for unstable training behavior.\nNow, if it’s good to normalize the data before it goes into the network, maybe also normalizing inside the network would be better! In fact, we have a special kind of layer that can do this, the batch normalization layer. A batch normalization layer looks at each batch as it comes in, first normalizing the batch with its own mean and standard deviation, and then also putting the data on a new scale with two trainable rescaling parameters. Batchnorm, in effect, performs a kind of coordinated rescaling of its inputs.\nMost often, batchnorm is added as an aid to the optimization process (though it can sometimes also help prediction performance). Models with batchnorm tend to need fewer epochs to complete training. Moreover, batchnorm can also fix various problems that can cause the training to get “stuck”. Consider adding batch normalization to your models, especially if you’re having trouble during training.\nlayers.Dense(16),\nlayers.BatchNormalization(),\nlayers.Activation('relu'),\nAnd if you add it as the first layer of your network it can act as a kind of adaptive preprocessor, standing in for something like Sci-Kit Learn’s StandardScaler.\n\n\n\n\nNow we’re going to apply neural networks to another common machine learning problem: classification.\n\n\nClassification into one of two classes is a common machine learning problem. These are all binary classification problems.\nBefore using this data we’ll assign a class label: one class will be 0 and the other will be 1. Assigning numeric labels puts the data in a form a neural network can use.\n\n\n\nAccuracy is one of the many metrics in use for measuring success on a classification problem. Accuracy is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions: accuracy = number_correct / total.\nThe problem with accuracy (and most other classification metrics) is that it can’t be used as a loss function. SGD needs a loss function that changes smoothly, but accuracy, being a ratio of counts, changes in “jumps”. So, we have to choose a substitute to act as the loss function. This substitute is the cross-entropy function.\nNow, recall that the loss function defines the objective of the network during training. With regression, our goal was to minimize the distance between the expected outcome and the predicted outcome. We chose MAE to measure this distance.\nFor classification, what we want instead is a distance between probabilities, and this is what cross-entropy provides. Cross-entropy is a sort of measure for the distance from one probability distribution to another.\n\n\n\nGraphs of accuracy and cross-entropy.\n\n\nThe technical reasons we use cross-entropy are a bit subtle, but the main thing to take away from this section is just this: use cross-entropy for a classification loss; other metrics you might care about (like accuracy) will tend to improve along with it.\n\n\n\nThe cross-entropy and accuracy functions both require probabilities as inputs, meaning, numbers from 0 to 1. To covert the real-valued outputs produced by a dense layer into probabilities, we attach a new kind of activation function, the sigmoid activation.\n\n\n\nThe sigmoid graph is an ‘S’ shape with horizontal asymptotes at 0 to the left and 1 to the right.\n\n\nTo get the final class prediction, we define a threshold probability. Typically this will be 0.5, so that rounding will give us the correct class: below 0.5 means the class with label 0 and 0.5 or above means the class with label 1. A 0.5 threshold is what Keras uses by default with its accuracy metric.\n\n\n\nimage-20211006193905258"

As a result, the market is less efficient. However, investors with superior information and skill may have an advantage in exploiting the market inefficiencies.\n\n\nShares of a REIT are actively traded and more likely to reflect market value. In addition, investing in a REIT can provide exposure to a diversified real estate portfolio. Finally, investors don’t need property management expertise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012110300224\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent income\nCapital appreciation\nInflation hedge\nDiversification - Real estate, especially private equity investment, is less than perfectly correlated with the returns of stocks and bonds.\nTax benefits - In the United States, the depreciable life of real estate is usually shorter than the actual life. As a result, depreciation expense is higher, and taxable income is lower resulting in lower income taxes. Also REITs do not pay taxes in some countries, which allow investors to escape double taxation.\n\n\n\n\n\nBusiness condition\nNew property lead time\nCost and availability of capital - Demand for real estate is reduced when debt capital is scarce and interest rates are high. Real estate price can be affected by capital market forces without changes in demand from tenants.\nUnexpected inflation - Real estate values may not keep up with inflation when markets are weak and vacancy rates are high.\nDemographic factors - The size and age distribution of the local market population, the distribution of socioeconomic groups, and new household formation rates.\nLack of liquidity\nAvailability of information\nManagement expertise - Operational decisions-such as negotiating lease, property maintenance, marketing, and renovating the property\nLeverage - High LTV -> higher risk -> NOI에 큰 영향\nOther factors - natural disaster, and acts of terrorism\n\n\n\n\nReal estate investment has both bond-like and stock-like characteristics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012145035834\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOffice - Demand is heavily dependent on job growth\n\nIn a gross lease, the owner is responsible for the operating expenses, and in a net lease, the tenant if responsible.\nIn a net lease, the tenant bears the risk if the actual operating expenses are greater than expected.\nSome lease combine features from both gross and net lease.\n\nIndustrial - Demand is heavily dependent on the overall economy. Demand is also affected by import/export activity of the economy.\n\nNet lease are common\n\nRetail - Demand is heavily dependent on consumer spending.\n\nConsumer spending is affected by the overall economy, job growth, population growth, and savings rates.\nAn anchor tenant may receive favorable lease terms to attract them to the property. In turn, the anchor tenant will draw other tenants to the property.\nRetail tenants are often required to pay additional rent once sales reach a certain level. This unique feature is known as a percentage lease or percentage rent.\n\nMulti-family - Demand depends on population growth, especially in the age demographic that typically rents apartments.\n\nDemand is also affected by the cost of buying versus the cost of renting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012150031551\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause of the difficulty in measuring depreciation and obsolescence, the cost approach is most useful when the subject property is relatively new. The cost approach is often used for unusual properties or properties where comparable transactions are limited.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012150045029\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012150056453\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012150103973\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe concept of highest and best use is important in determining value. The highest and best use of a vacant site is not necessarily the use that results in the highest total value once a project is completed. Rather, the highest and best use of a vacant site is the use that produces the highest implied land value.\nNote that the highest and best use is not based on the highest value when the projects are completed but, rather, the highest implied land value.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012150113845\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the direct capitalization method, value is based on capitalizing the first year NOI of the property using a capitalization rate. With the discounted cash flow method, value is based on the present value of the property’s future cash flows using an appropriate discount rate. \\[\n\\\\\\text{Rental income if fully occupied}\n\\\\+ \\text{Other income}\n\\\\= \\text{Potential gross income}\n\\\\- \\text{Vacancy and collection loss}\n\\\\= \\text{Effective gross income}\n\\\\- \\text{Operating expense}\n\\\\= \\text{Net operating income}\n\\] \n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\text{cap rate} = \\text{discount rate} - \\text{growth rate}\n\\\\\\text{cap rate} = \\frac{\\text{NOI}_{1}}{\\text{value}}\n\\\\V_{0} = \\frac{\\text{NOI}_{1}}{\\text{cap rate}}\n\\\\\\text{cap rate} = \\frac{\\text{NOI}_{1}}{\\text{comparable sales price}}\n\\]\nIt is important to observe several comparable transactions when deriving the cap rate. Implicit in the cap rate derived from comparable transactions are investors’ expectations of income growth and risk. In this case, the cap rate is similar to the reciprocal of the price-earnings multiple for equity securities.\nAll Risks Yield (ARY) - The ARY in the cap rate and will differ from the discount rate if an investor expects growth in rents and value. \\[\n\\\\\\text{value} = V_{0} = \\frac{\\text{rent}_{1}}{\\text{ARY}}\n\\] If rents are expected to increase at a constant rate each year, the internal rate of return (IRR) can be approximately by summing the cap rate and growth rate.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154503538\n\n\n\n\n\nIf NOI is not representative of the NOI of similar properties because of a temporary issue, the subject property’s NOI should be stabilized. For example, suppose a property is temporarily experiencing high vacancy during a major renovation. In this case, the first-year NOI should be stabilized; NOI should be calculated as if the renovation is complete. Once the stabilized NOI is capitalized, the loss in value, as a result of the temporary decline in NOI, is subtracted in arriving at the value of the property.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012151124707\n\n\n \\[\n\\\\\\text{gross income multiplier} = \\frac{\\text{sales price}}{\\text{gross income}}\n\\\\\\text{value} = \\text{gross income} * \\text{gross income multiplier}\n\\] ball park figure (약식 계산 방법)\nA shortfall of the gross income multiplier is that it ignores vacancy rates and operating expenses. Thus, if the subject property’s vacancy rate and operating expenses are higher than those of the comparable transactions, an investor will pay more for the same rent.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154616705\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154520033\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012151506276\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012151512213\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154633226\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154541858\n\n\nLease structures can vary by country. For example, in the UK, it is common for tenants to pay all expenses. In this case, the cap rate is known as the ARY. Adjustments must be made when the contract rent (passing or term rent) and the current market rent (open market rent) differ. Once the lease expires, rent will likely be adjusted to the current market rent. In the UK, the property is said to have reversionary potential when the contract rent expires.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154100535\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154106156\n\n\nA variation of the term and reversion approach is the layer method.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154125299\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154131166\n\n\nUsing the term and reversion approach and the layer method, different cap rates were applied to the term rent and the current market rent after review. Alternatively, a single discount rate, known as the equivalent yield, could have been used. The equivalent yield is an average, although not a simple average, of the two separate cap rates.\nUsing the discounted cash flow method requires the following estimates and assumptions.\n\nProject income from existing leases\nLease renewal assumptions\nOperating expense assumptions - Operating expenses can be classified as fixed, variable, or a hybrid of the two.\nVacancy assumption\nEstimated resale price\nAppropriate discount rate - The discount rate should be higher than the mortgage rate because more risk.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154420042\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154426026\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012154650128\n\n\nUnder the direct capitalization method, a cap rate or income multiplier is applied to first-year NOI. Implicit in the cap rate or multiplier are expected increases in growth.\nUnder the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, the future cash flows, including the capital expenditures and terminal value, are projected over the holding period and discounted to present at the discount rate. Future growth of NOI is explicit in the DCF method.\nBecause of the inputs required, the DCF method is more complex than the direct capitalization method, as it focuses on NOI over the entire holding period and not just NOI in the first year. Choosing the appropriate discount rate and terminal cap rate are crucial as small differences in the rates can significantly affect value.\nFollowing are some common errors made using the DCF method:\n\nThe discount rate does not adequately capture risk.\nIncome growth exceeds expense growth.\nThe terminal cap rate and the going-in-cap rate are not consistent.\nThe terminal cap rate is applied to NOI that is atypical.\nThe cyclicality of real estate markets is ignored.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 1: Estimate the market value of the land.\nStep 2: Estimate the building’s replacement cost. Replacement cost is based on current construction costs and standards and should include any builder/developer’s profit.\n\nReplacement cost refers to the cost of a building having the same utility but constructed with modern building materials. (지금 구할 수 있는 소나무 사용) Reproduction cost refers to the cost of reproducing an exact replica of the building using the same building materials, architectural design, and quality of construction. (400년 된 소나무 사용) Replacement cost is usually more relevant for appraisal purposes because reproduction cost may be uneconomical.\n\nStep 3: Deduct depreciation including physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, locational obsolescence, and economic obsolescence. Physical deterioration is related to the building’s age and occurs as a result of normal wear and tear over time. Physical deterioration can be curable or incurable.\nAn item is incurable if the problem is not economically feasible to remedy. For example, the cost of fixing a structural problem might exceed the benefit of the repair. Since a incurable defect would not be fixed, depreciation can be estimated based on the effective age of the property relative to its total economic life. For example, the physical depreciation of a property with an effective age of 30 years and a 50-year total economic life is 60% (30 year effective age / 50 year economic life).\nFunctional obsolescence is the loss in value resulting from defects in design that impairs a building’s utility.\nLocational obsolescence occurs when the location is no longer optional. A prison is built down the street making the location of the apartment complex less desirable.\nEconomic obsolescence occurs when new construction is not feasible under current economic conditions. This can occur when rental rates are not sufficient to support the property.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012155820063\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012155826189\n\n\nBecause of the difficulty in measuring depreciation and obsolescence, the cost approach is most useful when the subject property is relatively new.\nThe cost approach is sometimes considered the upper limit of value since an investor when never pay more than the cost to build a comparable building.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012160342110\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012155931379\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012155938894\n\n\nThe sales comparison approach is most useful when there are a number of properties similar to the subject that have been recently sold, as is usually the case with single-family homes. Even in an active market, there may be limited transactions of specialized property types, such as regional malls and hospitals. The sales comparison approach assumes purchaser are acting rationally. However, there are times when purchaser become overly exuberant and market bubbles occur.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012160351917\n\n\n\n\n\nAn important part of the appraisal process involves determining the final estimate of value by reconciling the value differences in the three approaches.\nFor example, an appraiser might apply a higher weight to the value obtained with the sales comparison approach when the market is active with plenty of comparable properties. Alternatively, if the subject property is old and estimating depreciation is difficult, an appraiser might apply a lower weight to the cost method.\n\n\n\n\n\nLease review and rental history\nConfirm the operating expenses by examining bills\nReview cash flow statement\nObtain an environmental report to identify the possibility of contamination\nPerform a physical/engineering inspection\nInspect the title and other legal documents for defeiciencies\nHave the property surveyed to confirm the boundaries and identify easements (사용권)\nVerify compliance with zoning laws, building codes, and environmental regulations\nVerify payment of taxes, insurance, special assessments, and other expenditures\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA popular index in the United States in the NCREIF Property Index (NPI). Member of NCREIF, mainly investment managers and pension fund sponsors, submit appraisal data quarterly, and NCREIF calculates the return as follows: \\[\n\\\\\n\\text{return} = \\frac{NOI - \\text{capital expenditures} + (\\text{end market value} - \\text{beg market value})}{\\text{beginning market value}} \\\\\n\\] Appraisal-based indices tend to lag actual transactions because actual transactions occur before appraisals are performed. Thus, a change in price may not be reflected in appraised values until the next quarter or longer if a property is not appraised every quarter. Also, appraisal lag tends to smooth the index; that is, reduce its volatility, much like a moving average reduces volatility. Finally, appraisal lag results in lower correlation with other asset classes. Appraisal lag can be adjusted by unsmoothing the index or by using a transaction-based index.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012161208117\n\n\n\n\n\nA repeat-sales index relies on repeat sales of the same property.\nA hedonic index requires only one sale. A regression is developed to control for differences in property characteristics such as size, age, location, and so forth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\n\\text{DSCR} = \\frac{\\text{first-year\\, NOI}}{\\text{debt service}} \\\\\n\\text{LTV} = \\frac{\\text{loan amount}}{\\text{appraisal value}} \\\\\n\\]\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\n\\text{equity dividend rate} = \\frac{\\text{first year cash flow}}{\\text{equity}} \\\\\n\\]\n\n\n\nIn order to calculate the IRR with leverage, we need to consider the cash flows over the entire holding period including the change in value of the original investment.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012162703898\n\n\nWe can see the effects of leverage by calculating an unleveraged IRR. In this case, the initial cash outflow is higher because no debt is incurred.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012162756918\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012162821449\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREITs are tax-advantaged companies (trusts) that are for most part exempt from corporate income tax. Equity REITs are actively managed, own income-producing real estate. Still diversifying holdings by geography and other factors.\n\n\n\nREOCs are not tax-advantaged; rather, they ordinarily corporations that own real estate. A business will form as a REOC if it is ineligible to organized as REIT. For example, the firm may intend to develop and sell real estate rather than generating cash flow rental payments, or the firm may be based in a country that does not allow tax-advantaged REITs.\n\n\n\nResidential or commercial mortgage-backed securities are publicly traded asset-backed securitized debt obligations that receive cash flows from an underlying pool of mortgage loans. These loans may be for commercial properties (in the case of CMBS) or on residential properties (in the case of RMBS). Real estate debt securities represent a far larger aggregate market value than do publicly traded real estate equity securities.\n\n\n\nMortgage REITs invest primarily in mortgage, mortgage securities, or loans that are secured by real estate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperior liquidity - Because REIT and REOC shares trade daily on a stock exchange.\nLower minimum investment - REIT or REOC shares trade for much smaller dollar amounts.\nLimited liability - The financial liability of a REIT investor is limited to the amount invested.\nAccess to premium properties - Some prestigious properties, such as high-profile shopping malls or other prominent or landmark buildings, are difficult to invest in directly.\nActive professional management - REITs and REOCs employ professional management to control expenses, maximize rents and occupancy rates, and sometimes to acquire additional properties.\nProtections accorded to publicly traded securities - Investors benefit from these securities regulations and from having a board overseeing the management on behalf of investors. Additionally, having public investors monitor the actions of management and the board of directors leads to financial and operating efficiency.\nGreater potential for diversification - Through REITs, however, an investor can diversify across property type and geographical location.\n\n\n\n\n\nExemption from taxation - As long as certain requirements are met, REITs enjoy favorable taxation, because a major part of REIT distributions are treated as a return of capital and are thus not taxable.\nPredictable earnings - REITs’ rental income is fixed by contracts, unlike the income of companies of other industries.\nHigh yield - REITs are obligated to pay out mot of their taxable income as dividends. Because of this high income payout ratio, the yields of REITs are higher than the yields on most other publicly traded equities.\n\n\n\n\n\nTaxes versus direct ownership - Depending on local laws, investors that make direct investments in properties may be able to deduct losses on real estate from taxable income or replace one property for a similar property (“like-kind exchange” in the US) without taxation on the gains.\nLack of control\nCosts of a publicly traded corporate structure\nPrice is determined by the stock market - While the appraisal-based value of a REIT may be relative stable, the market-determined price of a REIT share is likely to be much more volatile. Appraisals tend to be infrequent and backward-looking, while the stock market is continuous and reflects forward-looking values.\nStructural conflicts of interest - When the opportunity arises to sell properties or take on additional borrowing, a particular action may have different tax implications for REIT shareholders and for the general partners, which may tempt the general partners to act in their own interest, rather than in the interest of all stakeholders.\n\n\n\n\n\nLimited potential for income growth - REIT’s high rates of income payout limit REIT’s ability to generate future growth through reinvestment.\nForced equity issuance - When credit is difficult to obtain, a REIT may be forced to issue equity at a disadvantageous price.\nLack of flexibility - The rules that qualify REITs for favorable taxation also have a downside: REITs are prevented from making certain kinds of investments and from retaining most of their income. These limits may prevent REITs from being as profitable as they might otherwise be. REOCs, on the other hand, do not need to meet these requirements, and thus are free to retain income and devote those funds to property development when the REOC managers see attractive opportunities. REOCs are also not restricted in their use of leverage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelative importance of factors affecting REIT economic value\n\nShopping/Retail - Retail sales growth\nOffice - Job creation\nResidential - Population growth\nHealthcare - Population growth\nIndustrial - Retail sales growth\nHotel - Job creation\nStorage - Population growth\n\n\n\n\n\nExemption from corporate-level income taxes - In order to gain this status, REITs are required to distribute almost all of the REIT’s otherwise-taxable income, and a sufficient portion of assets and income must relate to rental income-producing real estate.\nHigh dividend yield - To maintain their tax-exempt status, REIT’s dividend yields are generally higher than yields on bonds or other equities.\nLow income volatility - REIT’s revenue streams tend to be relatively stable.\nSecondary equity offerings - Since REITs distribute most earnings, they likely to finance additional real estate acquisitions by selling additional shares.\n\n\n\n\nThe most risky REITs are those that invest in property sectors where significant mismatches between supply and demand are likely (particularly health care, hotel, and office REITs), as well as those sectors where the occupancy rates are most likely to fluctuate within a short period of time (especially hotels). Other items to consider in assessing the riskiness of a REIT relate to the properties’ financing, the leases that are in place, and the properties’ locations and quantity.\n\n\n\n\nRemaining lease terms - Short remaining lease terms provide an opportunity to raise rents in an expansionary economy, while long remaining lease terms are advantageous in a declining economy or softening rental market. Initial lease terms vary with the type of property-industrial and office buildings and shopping centers generally have long lease terms, while hotels and multi-family residential real estate have short lease terms.\nInflation protection - The level of contractual hedging against rising general price levels should be evaluated.\nIn-place rents versus market rents - An analyst should compare the rents that a REIT’s tenants are currently paying (in-place rents) with current rents in the market. If in-place rents are high, the potential exists for cash flows to fall going forward.\nCosts to re-lease space - When a lease expires, expenses typically incurred include lost rent, any new lease incentives offered, the costs of tenant-demanded improvements, and broker commissions.\nTenants’ financial health\nTenant concentration in the portfolio - Risk increases with tenant concentration.\nNew competition\nBalance sheet analysis - the amount of leverage, the cost of debt, and the debt’s maturity\nQuality of management\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\n\nStable revenue stream over the short term\n\nPrincipal risks\n\nDepends on consumer spending\n\nDue diligence considerations\n\nPer-square-foot sales and rental rates\nAnchor tenant - long-term fixed lease\nSmaller tenant - percentage lease\n\n\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\n\nLong (5-25 years) lease terms\nStable year-to-year income\n\nPrincipal risks\n\nChanges in office vacancy and rental rates\n\nDue diligence considerations\n\nNew space under construction\nQuality of office space (location, condition of building, and so on)\n\n\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\n\nOne-year leases\nStable demand\n\nPrincipal risks\n\nCompetition\nInducements (전입)\nRegional economy\nInflation in operating costs\n\nDue diligence considerations\n\nDemographics and income trends\nAge and competitive appeal\nCost of home ownership\nRent controls by local government\n\n\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\n\nLess cyclical than some other REIT types\n5-25 year net leases\nChange in income and values are slow\n\nPrincipal risks\n\nShifts in the composition of local and national industrial bases and trade\n\nDue diligence Considerations\n\nTrends in tenants’ requirements\nObsolescence of existing space\nNeed for new types of space\nProximity to transportation (airport, seaport, road)\nTrends in local supply and demand\n\n\n\n\nInvestment characteristics\n\nVariable income\nSector is cyclical because it is not protected by long-term leases\n\nPrincipal risks\n\nExposed to business-cycle\nChanges in business and leisure travle\nExposure to travel distruptions\n\nDue diligence considerations\n\nOccupancy, room rates, and operating profit margins vs. industry average\nRevenue per available room (RevPAR)\nTrends in forward bookings\nMaintenance expenditures\nNew construction in local markets\nFinancial leverage\nMargin level\nF&B sales\n\n\n\n\nself-storage, 개인 물건 보관 창고\nInvestment characteristics\n\nSpace is rented under gross leases and on a monthly basis\n\nPrincipal risks\n\nEase of entry can lead to overbuilding\n\nDue diligence considerations\n\nConstruction of new competitive facilities\nTrends in housing sales\nDemographic trends\nNew business start-up activity\nSeasonal trends in demand for storage facilities that can be significant in some markets\n\n\n\n\n\nNAVPS (net asset value per share) is the (per-share) amount by which assets exceed liabilities, using current market values rather than accounting book values. NAVPS is generally considered the most appropriate measure of the fundamental value of REITs (and REOCs). If the market price of a REIT varies from NAVPS, this is seen as a sign of over- or undervaluation.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012182300807\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012182315331\n\n\n \\[\n\\\\\n\\text{step 1: }\\text{property value} = \\frac{\\text{1st\\, year\\, NOI}}{\\text{cap rate}} \\\\\n\\text{step 2: }\\text{Total Net Asset Value} = \\text{property value} + \\text{other tangible assets} - \\operatorname{Liabilities} \\\\\n\\text{step 3: }\\text{NAVPS} = \\frac{\\text{Total NAV}}{\\text{number of outstanding shares}} \\\\\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\n\\text{Accounting net earnings}\n\\\\+ \\text{Depreciation and amortization expense}\n\\\\- \\text{Gains from sales of property}\n\\\\+ \\text{Losses from sales of property}\n\\\\= \\text{Funds from operations} \\\\\n\\]\nDepreciation is added back under the premise that accounting depreciation often exceeds economic depreciation for real estate. Gains from sales of property are excluded because these are not considered to be part of continuing income.\n\n\n\nAFFO is also known as cash available for distribution (CAD) or funds available for distribution (FAD). \\[\n\\\\\\text{FFO\\, (funds\\, from\\, operations)}\n\\\\- \\text{Non-cash\\, (straight-line)\\, rent\\, adjustment}\n\\\\- \\text{Recurring\\, maintenance-type\\, capital\\, expenditures\\, and\\, leasing\\, commissions}\n\\\\= \\text{AFFO\\, (adjusted\\, funds\\, from\\, operations)} \\\\\n\\] Straight-line rent refers not to the cash rent paid during the lease but rather to the average contractual rent over a lease period-the two figures differ by non-cash rent, which reflects contractually-increasing rental rates. Capital expenditures related to maintenance, as well expenses related to leasing the space in properties, are subtracted from FFO because they represent costs that must be expended in order to maintain the value of the properties.\nAFFO is considered a better measure of economic income than FFO because AFFO considered the capital expenditures that are required to sustain the property’s economic income. However, FFO is more frequently cited in practice, because AFFO relies more on estimates and is considered more subjective.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n일종의 intrinsic value in private market <-> public market value, 통상 public market value가 premium을 가짐 (liquidity)\nNet asset value is an indication of a REIT’s assets to a buyer in the private market. There have historically been significant differences between NAV estimates and the prices at which REITs actually trade.\nIf, in general, the market is trading at a premium to NAVPS, a value investor would select the investments with the lowest premium (everything else held constant).\n\n\n\nThere are three key factors that impact that price-to-FFO and price-to-AFFO of REITs and REOCs:\n\nExpectations for growth of FFO and AFFO.\nThe level of risks inherent in the underlying real estate.\nRisk related to the firm’s leverage and access to capital.\n\n\n\n\nDividend discount and discounted cash flow models of valuation are appropriate for use with REITs and REOCs, because these two investment structures typically pay dividends and thereby return a high proportion of their income to investors. For dividend discount models, an analysts will develop near-term, medium-term, and long-term growth forecasts and then use these values at the basis for two- or three-stage dividend discount models. To build a discounted cash flow model, analysts will generally create intermediate-term cash flow projections plus a terminal value that is developed using historical cash flow multiples.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012184113171\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012184030323\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012184035719\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012184041661\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012184124743\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sources of this increased value are thought to come from the following:\n\nThe ability to re-engineering the portfolio company and operate it more efficiently.\nThe ability to obtain debt financing on more advantageous terms.\nSuperior alignment of interests between management and private equity ownership.\n\n\n\nExperienced industry CEOs, CFOs, and other former senior executives. These executives can share their expertise and contracts with portfolio company management.\n\n\n\nA second source of added value is from more favorable terms on debt financing. In PE firms, debt is more heavily utilized and is quoted as a multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) as opposed to a multiple of equity, as for public firm.\nThe central proposition of the Modigliani-Miller theorems is that the use of debt versus equity is inconsequential for firm value. However, once the assumption of no taxes is removed from their model, the tax savings from the use of debt increases firm value. The use of greater amount of financial leverage may increase firm value in the case of private equity firms. Because these firms have a reputation for efficient management and timely payment of debt interest, this helps to allay concerns over their highly leveraged positions and helps maintain their access to the debt markets.\nAccording to this view, the requirement to make interest payments forces the portfolio companies to use free cash flow more efficiently because interest payments must be made on the debt.\nMuch of the debt financing for private equity firms comes from the syndicated loan market, but the debt is often repackaged and sold as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Private equity firms may also issue high-yield bonds which are repackaged as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).\nA third source of value added for PE firms is the alignment of interests between private equity owners and the managers of the portfolio companies they own.\n\n\n\n\nIn many private equity transactions, ownership and control are concentrated in the same hands. In buyout transactions, management often has a substantial stake in the company’s equity. In many venture capital investments, the private equity firm offers advice and management expertise.\nIn private equity firms, managers are able to focus more on long-term performance because, unlike public companies, private companies do not face the scrutiny of analysis, shareholders, and the broader market. This also allows the private equity firms to hire managers that are capable of substantial restructuring efforts.\n\n\nPrivate equity firms use a variety of mechanisms to align the interests of the managers of portfolio companies with the private equity firm’s interests.\n\nCompensation - Compensation that is closely linked to the company’s performance.\nTag-along, drag-along clauses\nBoard representation - The private equity firm is ensured control through board representation.\nNoncompete clauses - Company founders must agree to clauses that prevent them from competing against the firm within a prespecified period of time.\nPriority in claims - Private equity firms receive their distributions before other owners, often in the form of preferred dividends. They also have priority on the company’s assets if the portfolio company is liquidated.\nRequired approvals - Changes of strategic importance (e.g., acquisitions, divestitures, and changes in the business plan) must be approved by the private equity firm.\nEarn-outs - There are used predominantly in venture capital investments. Earn-outs tie the acquisition price paid by the private equity firm to the portfolio company’s future performance over a specified time period.\n\n\n\n\n\n경영권 획득 여부 차이\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCharacteristics\nVenture Capital Investments\nBuyout Investments\n\n\n\n\nCash Flows\nLow predictability with potentially unrealistic projections\nStable and predictable cash flows\n\n\nProduct Markets\nNew product market with uncertain future\nStrong market position with a possible niche position\n\n\nProducts\nProduct is based on new technology with uncertain prospects\nEstablished products\n\n\nAsset Base\nWeak\nSubstantial base that can serve as collateral\n\n\nManagement Team\nNew team although individual members typically have a strong entrepreneurial record\nStrong and experienced\n\n\nFinancial Leverage\nLow debt use with a majority of equity financing\nHigh amount of debt with a large percentage of senior debt and substantial amounts of junior and mezzanine debt\n\n\nRisk Assessment\nRisk is difficult to estimate due to new technologies, markets, and company history\nRisk can be estimated due to industry and company maturity\n\n\nExit\nExit via IPO or company sale is difficult to forecast\nExit is predictable\n\n\nOperations\nHigh cash burn rate required due to company and product immaturity\nPotential exists for reduction in inefficiencies\n\n\nWorking Capital Required\nIncreasing requirements due to growth\nLow requirements\n\n\nDue Diligence Performed by Private Equity Firms\nPrivate equity firms investigate technological and commercial prospects; investigation of financials is limited due to short history\nPrivate equity firms perform extensive due diligence\n\n\nGoal Setting\nGoals are milestone set in business plan and growth strategy\nGoal reference cash flows, strategic plan, and business plan\n\n\nPrivate Equity Investment Returns\nHigh returns come from a few highly successful investments with write-offs from less successful investments\nLow variability in the success of investments with failures being rare\n\n\nCapital Market Presence\nGenerally not active in capital markets\nActive in capital markets\n\n\nSales Transactions\nMost companies are sold as a result of the relationship between venture capital firm and entrepreneurs\nCompanies are typically sold in an auction-type process\n\n\nAbility to Grow Through Subsequent Funding\nCompanies are less scalable as subsequent funding is typically smaller\nStrong performances can increase subsequent funding amounts\n\n\nSource of General Partner’s Variable Revenue\nCarried interest is most common, transaction and monitoring fees are less common\nCarried interest, transaction fees, and monitoring fees\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPublic companies are bough and sold on regulated exchange daily. Private companies, however, are bought by buyers with specific interests at specific points in time, with each potential buyer possibly having a different valuation for the company. Furthermore, valuing a private company is more difficult than valuing public companies because PE firms often transform and reengineering the portfolio company such that cash flow estimates are difficult to obtain.\n\n\n\n\nDiscounted cash flow (DCF) analysis is most appropriate for companies with a significant operating history.\nA relative value or market approach applies a price multiple, such as the price-earnings ratio. This approach requires predictable cash flows and a significant history.\nReal option analysis is applicable for immature companies with flexibility in their future strategies.\nReplacement cost - It is generally not applicable to mature companies.\nVenture capital method and the leveraged buyout method\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012195838937\n\n\n\n\n\nOther considerations for valuing private equity portfolio companies are control premiums, country risk, and marketability and illiquidity discounts.\n\n\n\nTo value private equity portfolio companies, many investors use market data from similar publicly traded companies, most commonly the price multiples from comparable public companies. However, it is often difficult to find public companies at the same stage of development, same line of business, same capital structure, and same risk. A decision must also be made as to whether trailing or future earnings are used. For these reasons, a relative value or market approach should be used carefully.\n\n\n\nMarket data is also used with discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, with beta and the cost of capital estimated from public companies while adjusting for differences in operating and financial leverage between the private and public comparables. In DCF analysis, an assumption must be made regarding the company’s future value. Typically a terminal value is calculated using a price multiple of the company’s EBITDA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012195849511\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012195945557\n\n\n\n\nIn a buyout transaction, the buyer acquires a controlling equity position in a target company. Buyouts include takeovers, management buyouts (MBOs), and leveraged buyouts(LBOs). This review focuses on LBOs, in which a high amount of debt is used to finance a substantial portion of the acquisition. The financing of a LBO typically involves senior debt, junk bonds, equity, and mezzanine finance. Mezzanine finance is a hybrid debt and equity and can be structured to suit each particular transaction.\n\n\n\n\nThe view of the LBO transaction, referred to as the LBO model, is not a form of valuation but rather a method of factoring in the company’s capital structure and other parameters to determine the return the private equity firm should expect from the transaction. The objective is not to value the company but to determine the maximum price in negotiation that the private equity firm should pay for its stake.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012195905223\n\n\nthree main inputs:\n\nThe target company’s forecasted cash flows\nThe expected returns to the providers of the financing\nThe total amount of financing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\\\\\text{investment cost} + \\text{earnings growth} + \\text{increase in price multiple} + \\text{reduction in debt} = \\text{exit value}\n\\]\n\n\n\nimage-20211012211657003\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012211702287\n\n\nThe components of the return are:\n\nThe return on the preference shares for the private equity firm.\nThe increased multiple upon exit.\nThe reduction in the debt claim.\n\nIn most LBOs, most of the debt is senior debt that will amortize over time. In the preceding example, the debtholders’ claim on assets was reduced from $600 to $250. The use of debt in this example is advantageous and magnifies the returns to the equityholders.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012212834424\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012212847111\n\n\n\n\nThe post-money valuation of the investee company is: \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{PRE} + \\operatorname{INV} = \\operatorname{POST}\n\\\\\\text{The ownership proportion of the venture capital investor} = \\operatorname{INV} / \\operatorname{POST}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\nThe pre-money valuation and investment will be negotiated between the investee company and the VC investor. Additionally, the VC investor should keep in mind that his ownership could be diluted in the future due to future financing, conversion of convertible debt into equity, and the issuance of stock options to management.\nIt is difficult to forecast the cash flows for a VC portfolio company. Discounted cash flow analysis (the income approach) is not usually used as the primary valuation method for VC companies. It is also difficult to use a relative value or market approach. This is because a VC company is often unique, and there many be no comparable companies to estimate a benchmark price multiple from. A replacement cost approach may also be difficult to apply. Alternative methodologies include real option analysis and the venture capital method.\nTo estimate the pre-money valuation, the VC investor typically examines the company’s intellectual property and capital, the potential for the company’s products, and its intangible assets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nValuation Issue\nBuyout\nVenture Capital\n\n\n\n\nApplicability of DCF Method\nFrequently used to estimate value of equity\nLess frequently used as cash flows are uncertain\n\n\nApplicability of Relative Value Approach\nUsed to check the value from DCF analysis\nDifficult to use because there may be no truly comparable companies\n\n\nUse of Debt\nHigh\nLow as equity is dominant form of financing\n\n\nKey Drivers of Equity Return\nEarnings growth, increase in multiple upon exit, and reduction in the debt\nPre-money valuation, investment, and subsequent dilution\n\n\n\nValuation methodologies for buyouts need to factor in the level and pattern of leverage over the investment term.\nEarn-out - target company의 상승을 따라가는 것\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe means and timing of the exit strategy influence the exit value.\n\nan initial public offering (IPO)\nsecondary market sale\nmanagement buyout (MBO)\nliquidation\n\n\n\n\nAn IPO usually results in the highest exit value due to increased liquidity, greater access to capital, and the potential to hire better quality managers. However, an IPO is less flexible, more costly, and a more cumbersome process than the other alternatives.\nIPOs are most appropriate for companies with strong growth prospects and a significant operating history and size. The timing of an IPO is key.\nVC\n\n\n\nIn a secondary market sale, the company is sold to another investor or to another company interested in the purchase for strategic reasons. Secondary market sales from one investor to another are quite frequent, especially in the case of buyouts. VC portfolio companies are sometimes exited via a buyout to another firm, but VC companies are usually too immature to support a large amount of debt. Secondary market sales result in the second highest company valuation after IPOs.\nTrade sale, M&A\nBuyout\n\n\n\nIn an MBO, the company is sold to management, who utilize a large amount of leverage. The resulting high leverage may limit management’s flexibility.\n\n\n\nWhen the company is deemed no longer visible and usually results in a low value. There is potential for negative publicity as a result of displaced employees and from the obvious implications of the company’s failure to reach its objectives.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a portfolio company cannot be sold due to weak capital markets, the private equity firm may want to consider buying another portfolio company at depressed prices, merging the two companies, and waiting until capital market conditions improve to sell both portfolio companies as one.\nWhen an exit is anticipated in the next year or two, the exit valuation multiple can be forecasted without too much error. Beyond this time horizon, however, exit multiples become much more uncertain and stress testing should be performed on wide range of possible values.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012222056320\n\n\n\n\nThe limited partners (LPs) provide funding and do not have an active role in the management of the investments. Their liability is limited to what they have invested. The general partner (GP) in a limited partnership is liable for all the firm’s debts and, thus, has unlimited liability. The GP is the manager of the fund.\nAnother form of private equity fund structure is the company limited by shares. It offers better legal protection to the partners, depending on the jurisdiction. Most fund structures are closed end, meaning that investors can only redeem the investment at specified time periods.\nThe private equity firm usually spends a year or two raising funds. Funds are then drawn down (capital call) for investment, after which returns are realized. Most private equity funds last 10 to 12 years but can have their life extended another 2 to 3 years.\n\n\n\nPrivate equity investments are often only available to qualified investors, the definition of which depends on the jurisdiction. In the United States, the individual must have at least $1 million in assets.\nIf the fund is oversubscribed, the GP has greater negotiating power.\nThe terms of the fund should be focused towards aligning the interests of the GP and LPs and specifying the compensation of the GP.\n\n\n\nCommitted capital is the amount of funds promised by investors to private equity funds. Paid-in capital is the amount of funds actually received from investors (also referred to as invested capital).\n\n\nThese are fees paid to the GP on annual basis as a percent of committed capital. Management fees could instead be based on NAV or paid-in capital.\n\n\n\nThere are paid by third parties to the GP in their advisory capacity (e.g., for investment banking services, such as arranging a merger).\n\n\n\nThis is the GP’s share of the fund profits.\n\n\n\nThis specifies the allocation of equity between stockholders and management of the portfolio company and allows management to increase their allocation, depending on company performance.\n\n\n\nThis is the IRR that the fund must meet before the GP can receive carried interest.\n\n\n\nThe stated total maximum size of the PE fund, specified as an absolute figure. It is a negative signal if actual funds ultimately raised are significantly lower than targeted.\n\n\n\nThis is the year the fund was started and facilitates performance comparisons with other funds.\n\n\n\nAs discussed previously, this is the life of the firm and is usually ten years.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012222106796\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012214827897\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a key named executive leaves the fund or does not spend a sufficient amount of time at the fund, the GP may be prohibited from making additional investments until another key executive is selected.\n\n\n\nThis specified the fund performance information that can be disclosed. Note that the performance information for underlying portfolio companies is typically not disclosed.\n\n\n\nIn a deal-by-deal method, carried interest can be distributed after each individual deal. The disadvantage of this method from the LP’s perspective is that one deal could earn $10 million and another could lose $10 million, but the GP will received carried interest on the first deal, even though the LPs have not earned an overall positive return.\nIn the total return method, carried interest is calculated on the entire portfolio. There are two variants of the total return method: 1) carried interest can be paid only after the entire committed capital is returned to LPs; or 2) carried interest can be paid when the value of the portfolio exceeds invested capital by some minimum amount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis clause allows a GP to be fired if a supermajority (usually 75% or more) of the LPs agree to do so.\n\n\n\nThis provision allows for the firing of the GP or the termination of a fund given sufficient cause (e.g., a material breach of fund prospectus).\n\n\n\nThese specify leverage limits, a minimum amount of diversification, etc.\n\n\n\nThis provision allows the LPs to invest in other funds of the GP at low or no management fees. The provision also prevents the GP from using capital from different funds to invest in the same portfolio company.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012215558904\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012215603136\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt cost, adjusting for subsequent financing and devaluation.\nAt the minimum of cost or market value.\nBy revaluing a portfolio company anytime there is new financing.\nAt cost, with no adjustment until exit.\nBy using a discount factor for restricted securities (e.g, those that can only be sold to qualified investors).\nLess frequently, by applying illiquidity discounts to values based on those of comparable publicly traded companies.\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, if the NAV is only adjusted when there are subsequent rounds of financing, then the NAV will be more stable when financing are infrequent.\nSecond, there is no definitive method of calculating NAV for a private equity fund because the market value of portfolio companies is usually not certain until exit.\nThird, undrawn LP capital commitments are not included in the NAV calculation but are essentially liabilities for the LP.\nFourth, the investor should be aware that funds with different strategies and maturities may use different valuation methodologies. In the early stages, method based on comparables may be used.\nFinally, it is usually the GP who values the fund. LPs are increasingly using third parties to value private equity funds.\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012222118978\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, private equity funds have returns that tend to persist.\nSecond, the return discrepancy between outperformers and underperformers is very large and can be as much as 20%.\nThird, private equity investments are usually illiquid, long-term investments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012222202864\n\n\n\n\n\nLiquidity risk\nUnquoted investments risk\nCompetitive environment risk - The competition for finding reasonably-priced private equity investments may be high.\nAgency risk - The managers of private equity portfolio companies may not act in the best interests of the private equity firm and investors.\nCapital risk - Increases in business and financial risks may result in a withdrawal of capital. Portfolio companies may find the subsequent rounds of financing are difficult to obtain.\nRegulatory risk\nTax risk\nValuation risk - The valuation of private equity investments reflects subjective, not independent, judgment.\nDiversification risk - Private equity investments may be poorly diversified.\nMarket risk - Private equity is subject to long-term changes in interest rates, exchange rates, and other market risks. Short-term changes are usually not significant risk factors.\n\n\n\n\n\nTransaction costs - These costs include those from due diligence, bank financing, legal fees from acquisition, and sales transactions in portfolio companies.\nInvestment vehicle fund setup costs - The legal and other costs of setting up the fund are usually amortized over the life of the fund.\nAdministrative costs - These are charged on a yearly basis and include custodian, transfer agent, and accounting costs.\nAudit costs\nManagement and performance costs - 2% for the management fee and a 20% fee for performance.\nDilution costs - Additional rounds of financing and stock options granted to portfolio company management will result in dilution. This is also true for options issued to the private equity firm.\nPlacement fees - Placement agents who raise funds for private equity firms may charge up-front fees as much as 2% or annual trailer fees as a percent of funds raised through limited partners.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe return metric recommended for private equity by the Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS) is the IRR. The IRR is a cash-weighted (money-weighted) return measure. Although the private equity fund portfolio companies are actually illiquid, IRR assumes intermediate cash flows are reinvested at the IRR.\n\n\n\nThe IRR can be calculated gross or net of fees. Gross IRR is the relevant measure for the cash flows between the fund and portfolio companies.\n\n\n\nNet IRR can differ substantially from Gross IRR because it is net of management fees, carried interest, and other compensation to the GP. Net IRR is the relevant measure for the cash flows between the fund and LPs and is therefore the relevant return metric for the LPs.\n\n\n\nMultiples are a popular tool of LPs due to their simplicity, ease of use, and ability to differentiate between realized and unrealized returns. Multiples, however, ignore the time value of money.\n\n\nPIC (paid-in capital)\nDPI (distributed to paid-in capital)\nRVPI (residual value to paid-in capital)\nTVPI (total value to paid-in capital)\n\n\n\n\nThe realized investments, with an evaluation of successes and failrues.\nThe unrealized investments, with an evaluation of exit horizons and potential problems.\nCash flow projections at the fund and portfolio company level.\nFund valuation, NAV, and financial statements.\n\nAs an example, consider a fund that was started before the financial market collapse of 2007. If the RVPI is large relative to the DPI, this indicates that the firm has not successfully harvested many of its investments and that the fund may have an extended J-curve (it is taking longer than realized to earn a positive return on its investments). The investor should carefully examine the GP’s valuations of the remaining portfolio companies, potential write-offs, and whether the routes for future exit have dried up.\n\n\n\n\nThe benchmarking of private equity investments can be challenging. Private equity funds vary substantially from one to another.\nBecause there are cyclical trends in IRR returns, the Net IRR should be benchmarked against a peer group of comparable private equity funds of the same vintage and strategy.\nNote also that the private equity IRR is cash flow weighted whereas most other asset class index returns are time weighted.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012224009277\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012224104884\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012224114211\n\n\n \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{NAV before distribution}_{t} = \\operatorname{NAV after distribution}_{t-1} + \\operatorname{capital called down}_{t} - \\operatorname{management fees}_{t} \\pm\\operatorname{Operation result}_{t}\n\\\\\\operatorname{NAV before distribution} - \\operatorname{GP carry} - \\operatorname{LP distribution} = \\operatorname{NAV after distribution}\n\\] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012224507257\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012224512707\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe discount rate used and the estimate of terminal value will strongly influence the current valuation.\nProjections by entrepreneurs are typically overly optimistic and based on an assumption that the company will not fail. Instead of arguing over the validity of the projections with the entrepreneurs, most investors simply apply a high discount rate that reflects both the probability of failure and lack of diversification available in these investments.\n\n\nTo adjust the discount rate to reflect the risk that the company may fail in any given year. \\[\n\\\\\\text{probability of failure} = q\n\\\\r^{*} = \\frac{1 + r}{1 - q} - 1\n\\] Alternatively, the investor could have deflated each future cash flow for the cumulative probability that the company will fail. The adjusted discount rate approach is more straightforward.\n\n\n\nimage-20211012225115729\n\n\n\n\n\nA second approach to generating a realistic valuation is to adjust the terminal value for the probability of failure or poor results. We should therefore use scenario analysis to calculate an expected terminal value, reflecting the probability of different terminal value under different assumptions.\nDifficulties\n\n진정으로 유사한 comparable 찾기 어려움\nvolatile multiple <- scenario analysis 적용\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012225254131\n\n\nIn summary, VC valuation is highly dependent on the assumption used and how risk is accounted for. Additionally, scenario and sensitivity analysis should be used to determine how changes in the input variables will affect the valuation of the company.\nThe purpose is to place some bounds on the value of the company before negotiations begin between the startup (investee) company and the private equity firm. The final price paid for the investee company will also be affected by the bargaining power of the respective parties.\n\n\n\n\n\nEnergy - crude oil, natural gas, and refined petroleum products\nIndustrial metals - aluminum, nickel, zinc, lead, tin, iron, and copper\nGrains - wheat, corn, soybeans, and rice\nLivestock - hogs, sheep, cattle, and poultry\nPrecious metals - gold, silver, and platinum\nSofts (cash crops) - coffee, sugar, cocoa, and cotton\n\n\n\n\nViscosity / Sulfur\nStorage - 장기보관\nDrilling / Extraction technology\nRefining technology\nEconomic cycle\nAlternative source of energy\nEnvironmental concern - ESG\nPolitical risk\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly stored for short period\nGeographic concentration\nSeasonal effect - vacation, travel, heating oil\n\n\n\n\n\nTransportation cost\nVery little processing\nAssociated gas / Unassociated gas\nSimilar to crude oil supply / demand\nMore influence from seasonality - heating, cooling\n\n\n\n\n\nGDP growth, business cycle\nLow storage cost\nPolitical factors - Union strike, environment\nLarge scale\n\n\n\n\n\nJewelry - value storage, hedge for inflation\nIndustrial - business cycle\n\n\n\n\n\nGrain price - Grain price up -> 도살 증가 -> price down -> 후에 price up\nWeather\nDisaster\nIncome growth in developing countries\n\n\n\n\n\nWeather - mild climate\nDisease\nIncome in developing countries\nConsumer taste\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrill -> Extract -> Transport -> Store -> Refine -> Transport\n\n\n\n\nMinimal processing\nCooled to liquid\nDeliver year round-seasonal demand\n\n\n\n\n\nSmelted\nStore indefinitely\nMonthly futures available\nEconomy of scale - Billions of dollars, significant time\n가격이 하락해도 계속 생산 -> chicken game\n\n\n\n\n\n동물별로 cycle이 다름\n냉동보관\n계절적 요인\n\n\n\n\n\nSeasonal\n수요예측 후 재배 시작\n남반구 / 북반구 rotation으로 서로 보완\n\n\n\n\n\n거의 매월 수확 - 전세계\n4년 후 수확 - 투자와 회수 time gap 존재\n생산자 futures 매도로 hedge\n\n\n\n\n\nUnlike stocks and bonds, commodities are physical assets, have no cash flows, and may incur storage and transportation costs.\nStocks and bonds (financial assets) can be valued by calculating the present value of their expected future cash flows. Commodities produce no earnings or cash flow; however, the current (spot) price of a commodity can be viewed as the discounted value of the expected selling price at some future date. Storage costs for commodities can lead to forward prices that are higher the further the forward settlement date is in the future.\n\n\n\nTraders and investors in the commodities market can be classified as informed investors-those who provide liquidity to the markets-and arbitrageurs. Hedger are considered informed investors because they either produce or use the commodity. Hedgers reduce their risk by buying (going long) or selling (going short) futures contracts. A corn farmer can reduce the uncertainty about the price she will receive for her corn by selling corn futures. A cattle producer, however, would hedge his price risk by buying corn futures to reduce his uncertainty about the cost of feed for the cattle.\nSpeculators take on commodity risk in futures markets and may act as informed investors, seeking to exploit an information or information processing advantage to profit from trading with hedgers. Speculators can also earn profits by providing liquidity to markets: buying futures when short hedgers (commodity producers) are selling and selling futures when long hedgers (commodity users) are buying. - market making, liquidity 제공\nArbitrageurs in the commodity markets are often those in the business of buying, selling, and storing the physical commodities when the difference between spot and futures prices is too large or too small based on the actual cost of storing the commodity. When the difference is too large, an arbitrageur can buy and store the commodity and sell it at its (too high) futures price. When the difference is too small, an arbitrageur can effectively “not store” the commodity by selling from his own inventory and going long futures, replacing the inventory at the future date.\nlarge difference -> long spot, short futures\nsmall difference -> short spot, long futures\nCommodity exchanges operate in many of the world’s financial centers to reflect the worldwide operation and consumption of commodities as well as the globalization of financial markets in general.\nCommodity market analysts, considered non-market participants, use market information to perform analytical work for various entities including governments, universities, economic forecasters, and commercial data analysis firms.\nCommodity regulators are responsible for the regulation of commodities markets around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211012235307425\n\n\nThe difference between the spot (cash) market price and the futures price for a date in the future in referred to as the basis of the particular contract. The difference between the futures price of a nearer maturity and the futures price of a more-distant maturity is known as the calendar spread.\nWhen futures price are higher at dates further in the future, the futures market (or futures curve) is said to be in contango. In a contango market, the calendar spread and basis are negative. Conversely, if futures prices are lower at dates further in the future, the market is said to be in backwardation, and the basis and calendar spread are positive.\nWhen a future market is in backwardation, long futures positions have a positive return component. Since futures prices converge to spot prices over the term of a future contract, there is a positive returns component from the passage of time.\nWhen a future market is in contango, there is a negative returns component for long futures positions. Convergence of futures prices to spot prices results in a decrease in the value of a long futures position.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n생산자 - 미래가격 확정희망\n그래서 Futures < spot\nNormal backwardation\n실증연구결과 - extra return X, 현실에서 contango 만연\n\n\n\n\n\nProducer and consumer hedging pressure 존재\nProducer pressure up -> backwardation / Consumer pressure up -> contango\n실제, producer pressure > consumer pressure\nProducer & Consumer는 speculation도 한다 -> hedging pressure과 backwardation/contango 상관관계 검증이 어려움\n\n\n\n\n\nBackwardation / contango rely on relationship between cost and benefit of storage\nCost > benefit -> Futures > Spot -> Contango / Cost < benefit -> Futures < spot -> Backwardation\nBenefit = convenience yield\nStorage cost up -> futures price up / convenience yield up -> futures price down\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211013000454237\n\n\nAn investor who desires long exposure to a commodity price will typically achieve this exposure through a derivative investment in forwards or futures.\nCollateral return, price return, and roll return\nIf US Treasury bills are deposited as collateral, the collateral return or collateral yield is simply the holding period yield on the T-bill.\nThe price return or spot yield on an investment in commodity futures is the change in spot prices. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{price return} = (\\operatorname{current price} - \\operatorname{previous price}) / \\operatorname{previous price}\n\\] This process is referred to as rolling over the position and leads to gains or losses which are termed the roll return or roll yield. The roll return can be positive if the futures price curve is in backwardation or negative if the futures price curve is in contango. \\[\n\\\\\\operatorname{roll return} = \\frac{\\operatorname{price of expiring futures contract} - \\operatorname{price of new futures contract}}{\\operatorname{price of expiring futues contract}}\n\\] Roll return has a relatively small impact on overall returns on commodity futures over the short term but can have a meaningful impact over longer periods.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211013000543780\n\n\nIn total return swap the swap buyer (the long) will receive periodic payments based on the change in the futures price of a commodity plus the return on the collateral, in return for a series of fixed payments.\nThe swap buyer instead may make a single payment at the initiation of the swap and then receive periodic payments based on the total returns, excess returns, or price volatility of a commodity, essentially “buying” exposure to the underlying risk factor.\nIn an excess return swap, a party may make a single payment at the initiation of the swap and then receive periodic payments of any percentage by which the commodity price exceeds some fixed or benchmark value, times the notional value of the swap. In months in which the commodity price does not exceed the fixed value, no payments are made.\nIn a basis swap, the variable payments are based on the difference between the prices of two commodities. Often two commodities are one that has liquid traded futures available for hedging and the other (the one the swap buyer actually uses in production) with no liquid futures contracts available. By combining a hedge using the liquid futures with a basis swap, the swap buyer can hedge the price risk he faces from the input that does not have a liquid futures market.\nIn a commodity volatility swap, the underlying factor is the volatility of the commodity’s price. If the volatility of the commodity’s price is higher than the expected level of volatility specified in the swap, the volatility buyer receives a payment. When actual volatility is lower than the specified level, the volatility seller receives a payment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimage-20211013001132649\n\n\nTo be most useful, an index should be investable.\nThe available commodity indexes differ in the following dimensions:\n\nWhich commodities are included\nThe weighting of the commodities in the index\nThe method of rolling contracts over as they near expiration\nThe method of rebalancing portfolio weights\n\nWhile no index methodology will consistently outperform another index methodology, differences in methodology do result in returns differences, at least over shorter periods. Over long periods, differences between the mix and weights of constituent commodities in individual indexes will result in differences between returns, as some commodities outperform others.\nIndexes may be equal weighted or weighted on some factor, such as the value of global production of an individual commodity or commodity sector. A production value weighted index will have more exposure to energy than to livestock or softs, for example.\nWith regard to roll methodology, a passive strategy may be a simply roll the expiring futures contracts into the near-month contract each month. A more active strategy would be to maximize roll return by selecting the further-out contracts with the greatest backwardation or smaller contango.\nThe frequency of rebalancing will also affect commodity index returns. Rebalancing portfolio weights will decrease return when prices are trending but increase returns when price changes are choppy and mean-reverting.\nWhile differences in index construction methodology will lead to difference among index returns over relative shorter periods, no one methodology is necessarily superior over longer periods. Correlations between returns on different indexes have been relatively high, while correlations between commodity indexes and returns on stocks and bonds have been low."
