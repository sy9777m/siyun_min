<h1>Trading strategy inputs</h1>
<section id="market-impact-cost" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="market-impact-cost">market impact cost</h2>
<p>Market impact comes from trading too quickly</p>
</section>
<section id="execution-risk" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="execution-risk">execution risk</h2>
<p>Execution risk comes from trading too slowly (risk of adverse price movements)</p>
</section>
<section id="order-characteristics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="order-characteristics">order characteristics</h2>
<p><strong>Side</strong> refers to the direction of the order (buy, sell, short buyback (cover), or short sell). A list of only buy orders or only sell orders will have greater market risk exposure compared to a list of buys and sells with offsetting market risk exposures.</p>
<p><strong>Absolute size</strong> refers to the number of securities being traded. larger orders will have a higher market impact cost than smaller orders.</p>
<p>With <strong>relative size</strong>, managers will often consider order size as a percentage of average daily volume (ADV). Orders that constitute a higher percentage of ADV are expected to have higher market impact costs.</p>
</section>
<section id="security-characteristics" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="security-characteristics">security characteristics</h2>
<p><strong>Security type</strong>. Different security types [e.g., underlying securities, ETFs, American depositary receipts (ADRs), global depositary receipt (GDRs), derivatives, and foreign exchange (FX) contracts] trade in different markets with different costs, regulations, and liquidity.</p>
<p><strong>Short-term alpha</strong>. For active managers, a high rate of alpha decay requires a more urgent trade strategy. A manager will also have higher urgency in adverse market conditions (i.e., buying into a rising market or selling into a falling market).</p>
<p><strong>Price volatility</strong>. High price volatility implies high execution risk, defined as the risk that an adverse price movement will occur over the trading horizon.</p>
<p><strong>Security liquidity</strong>. Greater liquidity decreases execution risk and market impact cost. Narrow bid-ask spreads and large volume available for trading (i.e., market depth) are two key indicators of high liquidity.</p>
</section>
<section id="market-conditions" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="market-conditions">market conditions</h2>
<p>Lower liquidity suggests longer trading horizons; however, higher volatility might cause investors to speed up trades and incur higher costs to avoid execution risk of adverse price movements.</p>
</section>
<section id="individual-risk-aversion" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="individual-risk-aversion">individual risk aversion</h2>
<p>A portfolio manager/trader with higher risk aversion is typically more concerned about the market risk of adverse movements in security prices than market impact costs and therefore will trade with more urgency.</p>
</section>
</section>
<section id="reference-prices" class="level1">
<h1>Reference prices</h1>
<section id="pre-trade-benchmarks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pre-trade-benchmarks">Pre-trade benchmarks</h2>
<p><strong>Decision price -</strong> 사기로 결정한 시점의 가격</p>
<p><strong>Previous close</strong> - This is the closing price on the previous day.</p>
<p><strong>Opening price</strong> - This is the opening price on the day.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival price</strong> - This is the price of the security when the order is sent to the market for execution.</p>
</section>
<section id="intraday-benchmarks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="intraday-benchmarks">Intraday benchmarks</h2>
<p><strong>Volume-weighted average price (VWAP)</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>VWAP is not appropriate for lightly-traded stocks.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Time-weighted average price (TWAP) -</strong> TWAP may be appropriate for managers who wish to remove the impact of outliers since they believe they are less able to participate in these extreme trades. It is also appropriate in market environments with highly fluctuating volume throughout the day.</p>
<ul>
<li>thinly traded and high volatility stock에도 적합</li>
<li>removes trade outliers</li>
<li>TWAP is appropriate for minimizing market impact and getting done the trade in one day.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="post-trade-benchmarks" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="post-trade-benchmarks">Post-trade benchmarks</h2>
<ul>
<li>closing price</li>
</ul>
<p>appropriate for index managers and mutual funds</p>
<p>The most frequently used post-trade benchmark is the closing price, often used by managers who wish to execute at the closing price to reduce the tracking error of the fund. A drawback of this benchmark is the since the closing price is not known until after the trading is completed, a manager cannot assessing trading performance during the trading horizon.</p>
</section>
<section id="price-target-benchmark" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="price-target-benchmark">Price target benchmark</h2>
<p>Price target benchmarks are prices used by profit-seeking managers aiming to earn short-term alpha, related to the manager’s view of the fair value of the security.</p>

<p>Execution method - computer algorithm</p>
</section>
<section id="long-term-alpha" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="long-term-alpha">Long-term alpha</h2>
<p>Objective - Trade over the long term due to changes in fundamental conditions.</p>
<p>Urgency - low</p>
<p>Reference prices - difficult to use in practice</p>
<ul>
<li>거래를 잘 했는지 알기 어려움</li>
</ul>
<p>Execution method - sell securities gradually over a few weeks in small parts to avoid information leakage and pressure on dealer’s prices.</p>
</section>
<section id="risk-rebalance" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risk-rebalance">Risk rebalance</h2>
<p>Objective - Rebalance or hedge risk exposure (e.g., reduce risk levels in liquid FX markets by liquidating long and short positions to bring fund volatility down to a target level).</p>
<p>Urgency - low</p>
<p>Reference prices - TWAP</p>
<p>Execution method - algorithmically target TWAP over the next couple of days.</p>
</section>
<section id="cash-flow-driven-client-redemption" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cash-flow-driven-client-redemption">Cash flow driven (client redemption)</h2>
<p>Objective - liquidate the holding to meet client redemptions</p>
<p>Urgency - the trade needs to be completed by the end of the trading day</p>
<p>Reference prices - closing price</p>
<p>Execution method - Execute a reasonable amount of liquidity in the closing auction; execute the reminder before the close of trading (e.g., at VWAP)</p>
<ul>
<li>VWAP - 오늘 전부 청산해야 함</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="cash-flow-driven-new-trade-mandate" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cash-flow-driven-new-trade-mandate">Cash flow driven (new trade mandate)</h2>
<p>Objective - invest new client funds (e.g., invest large amount with a mandate to track a small-cap index with a 3% tracking error). Performance measurement will begin at the current day’s closing price.</p>
<p>Urgency - liquidity is too low to execute in underlying securities by the end of the day, but immediate exposure is required by the client. Liquidity index futures contracts exist.</p>
<p>Reference prices - closing price</p>
<p>Execution method - obtain immediate exposure to index through a long position in index futures to eliminate cash drag. Build underlying stock positions over time to reduce market impact, while simultaneously unwinding the future position.</p>
<p>There are two issues with this method:</p>
<ul>
<li>There may not be a closing auction for the futures contract, in which case the futures trade would need to be done as close to the market close as possible.</li>
<li>The mandate must allow derivatives positions.</li>
</ul>

<ol type="1">
<li>too low liquidity</li>
<li>large volume</li>
<li>too urgent</li>
<li>fixed-income</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Principal trades (broker risk trades)</strong> - This is where dealer or market makers assume all or some of the risk relating to executing the order, which is priced into their spread. <strong>Quote-driven, over-the-counter (OTC)</strong>, or <strong>off-exchange markets</strong> are primarily principal trade markets. Principal trades also include <strong>request-for-quote (RFQ)</strong> markets where market makers do not provide continuous quotes, but only do so on request.</p>
<ul>
<li>broker가 거래를 떠안음</li>
<li>Quote-driven market = price-driven market = dealer market → dealer가 주도</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Agency trades</strong> - This is where the broker finds the other side of the trade, and risk for order execution remains with the portfolio manager/trader.</p>
</section>
<section id="electronic-trading" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="electronic-trading">Electronic trading</h2>
<p>Electronic trading generally involves <strong>direct market access (DMA)</strong> and/or algorithmic trading.</p>
<ul>
<li>order-driven market = auction market</li>
<li>구매자 주도</li>
<li>DMA는 1) when urgent 2) small trades</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="algorithmic-trading" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithmic-trading">Algorithmic trading</h2>
<p>small order size</p>
<p><strong>Algorithmic trading</strong> is the use of programmed rules to electronically trade orders, primarily used for two purposes: <strong>profit seeking and trade execution.</strong></p>
<p>Profit-seeking algorithms use real-time market data to determine which securities to buy and sell, and are employed by electronic market makers, quantitative funds, and high-frequency traders.</p>
<p>Execution algorithms trade according to the rule specified by the manager to meet their objectives.</p>
</section>
<section id="scheduled-algorithms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="scheduled-algorithms">Scheduled algorithms</h2>
<p>Scheduled algorithms are appropriate for <strong>relatively small orders in liquid markets</strong> for managers with <strong>less urgency</strong> (i.e., greater risk tolerance for longer execution periods) and/or who are concerned with <strong>minimizing the market impact</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>percent-of-volume (POV), VWAP, and TWAP algorithms</strong>. These execute trades using rules driven by historical volumes or specified time periods.</p>
<p><strong>POV algorithms</strong> (a.k.a. participation algorithms) send orders according to a volume participation schedule.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantage: They automatically exploit increased liquidity when available.</li>
<li>Disadvantage: They continue to trade at any (potentially adverse) price, and may not fill the order in a specified time if there is a lack of trading.
<ul>
<li>POV has the risk not to completely execute in one day.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>VWAP and TWAP algorithms are <strong>time-scaling algorithms</strong>. VWAP algorithms attempt to match the VWAP price for the period by carving up the trade and sending orders based on <strong>historical</strong> intraday volumes. The usual intraday volume profile is to trade more at the open and close and less in the middle of the day. TWAP algorithms perform a similar task; however, they ensure an equal number of shares is traded in each time period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Advantage - They ensure that a specified number of shares are executed in a specified time period.</li>
<li>Disadvantage - They may force trades in times of low liquidity or trade too little in times of high liquidity.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="liquidity-seeking-algorithms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="liquidity-seeking-algorithms">Liquidity-seeking algorithms</h2>
<p><strong>Liquidity-seeking algorithms</strong> (a.k.a. opportunistic algorithms) aim to take advantage of favorable liquidity conditions when offered by the market.</p>
<p>Liquidity-seeking algorithms are appropriate for <strong>larger orders in less liquid markets with higher urgency while trying to mitigate the market impact</strong>. They are also appropriate when a manger is concerned that displaying limit orders may lead to information leakage, or when liquidity is typically thin with sporadic episodes of high liquidity.</p>
<p>Liquidity-seeking algorithm is needed for large, urgent trades without having substantial market impact. Liquidity-seeking algorithm is also used when managers don’t want to leak information and lead adverse movement.</p>
</section>
<section id="arrival-price-algorithms" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="arrival-price-algorithms">Arrival price algorithms</h2>
<p><strong>Arrival price algorithms</strong> seek to trade close to market prices prevailing at the time the order is entered. These algorithms will trade more aggressively (i.e., faster) than other algorithms to trade more shares at close to the arrival price.</p>
<p>Arrival price algorithms are appropriate for <strong>relatively small orders in liquid markets</strong> for managers who believe prices are likely to <strong>move against them during the trade horizon</strong>, and therefore wish to <strong>trade more aggressively</strong>. They are also appropriate for more <strong>risk-averse managers who want to minimize execution risk</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="dark-strategyliquidity-aggregator" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="dark-strategyliquidity-aggregator">Dark strategy/liquidity aggregator</h2>
<p><strong>Dark strategies/liquidity aggregators</strong> execute trades in dark pools, with aggregator algorithms attempting to optimize trading across multiple dark venues.</p>
<p>Dark strategies/liquidity aggregators are appropriate for <strong>large orders in illiquid markets</strong>, and arrival price or scheduled algorithms would likely lead to high market impact. Since there is a lower change of execution in dark pools, these strategies are for managers that <strong>do not need to execute the full order immediately (less urgency)</strong>.</p>
</section>
<section id="sor" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="sor">SOR</h2>
<p><strong>Smart order routes (SORs)</strong> are algorithms that determine the best destination (either lit or dark) to route an electronic order to get the best result. SORs focus on getting the best price for market orders, or the highest probability of execution for limit orders.</p>
<p>SORs are appropriate for small market orders with low market impact where the market can move quickly, or for small limit orders with low information leakage where there are <strong>multiple potential execution venues</strong>.</p>
<section id="clustering" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="clustering">Clustering</h3>
<p>Clustering is a machine learning technique whereby a computer learns to identify which algorithm is optimal for different types of trades based on the key features of trades. the term clustering refers to the technique of grouping trades together with similar attributes.</p>

<h1>Characteristics of key markets</h1>
<section id="spot-foreign-exchange" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spot-foreign-exchange">Spot foreign exchange</h2>
<p>Spot foreign exchange trading takes place in OTC markets that use both electronic trading and high-touch broker approaches. The market works in three tiers: interbank, interdealer, and bank-to-client, with decreasing trade sizes and increasing spreads, respectively. For large urgent trades, RFQs are used with brokers. For large non-urgent trades, scheduled algorithms or high-touch agency approaches are used. Small trades are usually implemented using DMA.</p>
