<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="real-estate-characteristics">Real Estate Characteristics</h3>
<ul>
<li>Heterogeneity - No two property are exactly the same because of location, size, age, construction materials, and lease terms.</li>
<li>High unit value</li>
<li>Active management - Private real estate investment requires active property management.</li>
<li>High transaction costs - appraisers, lawyers, brokers, and construction personnel</li>
<li>Depreciation and desirability (매력도)</li>
<li>Cost and availability of debt capital</li>
<li>Lack of liquidity</li>
<li>Difficulty in determining price
<ul>
<li>Appraisals are usually to assess real estate values.</li>
<li>The combination of limited market participants and lack of knowledge of the local markets makes it difficult for an outsider to value property. As a result, the market is less efficient. However, investors with superior information and skill may have an advantage in exploiting the market inefficiencies.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Shares of a REIT are actively traded and more likely to reflect market value. In addition, investing in a REIT can provide exposure to a diversified real estate portfolio. Finally, investors don’t need property management expertise.</p>

<ul>
<li>Current income</li>
<li>Capital appreciation</li>
<li>Inflation hedge</li>
<li>Diversification - Real estate, especially private equity investment, is less than perfectly correlated with the returns of stocks and bonds.</li>
<li>Tax benefits - In the United States, the depreciable life of real estate is usually shorter than the actual life. As a result, depreciation expense is higher, and taxable income is lower resulting in lower income taxes. Also REITs do not pay taxes in some countries, which allow investors to escape double taxation.</li>

<li>Cost and availability of capital - Demand for real estate is reduced when debt capital is scarce and interest rates are high. Real estate price can be affected by capital market forces without changes in demand from tenants.</li>
<li>Unexpected inflation - Real estate values may not keep up with inflation when markets are weak and vacancy rates are high.</li>
<li>Demographic factors - The size and age distribution of the local market population, the distribution of socioeconomic groups, and new household formation rates.</li>
<li>Lack of liquidity</li>

<p>With the direct capitalization method, value is based on capitalizing the first year NOI of the property using a capitalization rate.

<p>It is important to observe several comparable transactions when deriving the cap rate. Implicit in the cap rate derived from comparable transactions are investors’ expectations of income growth and risk. In this case, the cap rate is similar to the reciprocal of the price-earnings multiple for equity securities.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="stabilized-noi">Stabilized NOI</h3>
<p>If NOI is not representative of the NOI of similar properties because of a temporary issue, the subject property’s NOI should be stabilized. For example, suppose a property is temporarily experiencing high vacancy during a major renovation. In this case, the first-year NOI should be stabilized; NOI should be calculated as if the renovation is complete. Once the stabilized NOI is capitalized, the loss in value, as a result of the temporary decline in NOI, is subtracted in arriving at the value of the property.</p>

<p>A shortfall of the gross income multiplier is that it ignores vacancy rates and operating expenses. Thus, if the subject property’s vacancy rate and operating expenses are higher than those of the comparable transactions, an investor will pay more for the same rent.</p>

<p>Lease structures can vary by country. For example, in the UK, it is common for tenants to pay all expenses. In this case, the cap rate is known as the ARY. Adjustments must be made when the contract rent (passing or term rent) and the current market rent (open market rent) differ. Once the lease expires, rent will likely be adjusted to the current market rent. In the UK, the property is said to have reversionary potential when the contract rent expires.</p>

<p>Using the term and reversion approach and the layer method, different cap rates were applied to the term rent and the current market rent after review. Alternatively, a single discount rate, known as the equivalent yield, could have been used. The equivalent yield is an average, although not a simple average, of the two separate cap rates.</p>
<p>Using the discounted cash flow method requires the following estimates and assumptions.</p>
<ul>
<li>Project income from existing leases</li>
<li>Lease renewal assumptions</li>
<li>Operating expense assumptions - Operating expenses can be classified as fixed, variable, or a hybrid of the two.</li>
<li>Vacancy assumption</li>
<li>Estimated resale price</li>
<li>Appropriate discount rate - The discount rate should be higher than the mortgage rate because more risk.</li>

<p>Under the direct capitalization method, a cap rate or income multiplier is applied to first-year NOI. Implicit in the cap rate or multiplier are expected increases in growth.</p>
<p>Under the discounted cash flow (DCF) method, the future cash flows, including the capital expenditures and terminal value, are projected over the holding period and discounted to present at the discount rate. Future growth of NOI is explicit in the DCF method.</p>
<p>Because of the inputs required, the DCF method is more complex than the direct capitalization method, as it focuses on NOI over the entire holding period and not just NOI in the first year. Choosing the appropriate discount rate and terminal cap rate are crucial as small differences in the rates can significantly affect value.</p>
<p>Following are some common errors made using the DCF method:</p>
<ul>
<li>The discount rate does not adequately capture risk.</li>
<li>Income growth exceeds expense growth.</li>
<li>The terminal cap rate and the going-in-cap rate are not consistent.</li>
<li>The terminal cap rate is applied to NOI that is atypical.</li>
<li>The cyclicality of real estate markets is ignored.</li>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cost-approach-1">Cost approach</h2>
<p>Step 1: Estimate the market value of the land.</p>
<p>Step 2: Estimate the building’s replacement cost. Replacement cost is based on current construction costs and standards and should include any builder/developer’s profit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacement cost refers to the cost of a building having the same utility but constructed with modern building materials. (지금 구할 수 있는 소나무 사용) Reproduction cost refers to the cost of reproducing an exact replica of the building using the same building materials, architectural design, and quality of construction. (400년 된 소나무 사용) Replacement cost is usually more relevant for appraisal purposes because reproduction cost may be uneconomical.</li>
</ul>
<p>Step 3: Deduct depreciation including physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, locational obsolescence, and economic obsolescence. Physical deterioration is related to the building’s age and occurs as a result of normal wear and tear over time. Physical deterioration can be curable or incurable.</p>
<p>An item is incurable if the problem is not economically feasible to remedy. For example, the cost of fixing a structural problem might exceed the benefit of the repair. Since a incurable defect would not be fixed, depreciation can be estimated based on the effective age of the property relative to its total economic life. For example, the physical depreciation of a property with an effective age of 30 years and a 50-year total economic life is 60% (30 year effective age / 50 year economic life).</p>
<p>Functional obsolescence is the loss in value resulting from defects in design that impairs a building’s utility.</p>
<p>Locational obsolescence occurs when the location is no longer optional. A prison is built down the street making the location of the apartment complex less desirable.</p>
<p>Economic obsolescence occurs when new construction is not feasible under current economic conditions. This can occur when rental rates are not sufficient to support the property.</p>

<p>The sales comparison approach is most useful when there are a number of properties similar to the subject that have been recently sold, as is usually the case with single-family homes. Even in an active market, there may be limited transactions of specialized property types, such as regional malls and hospitals. The sales comparison approach assumes purchaser are acting rationally. However, there are times when purchaser become overly exuberant and market bubbles occur.</p>

<p>An important part of the appraisal process involves determining the final estimate of value by reconciling the value differences in the three approaches.</p>
<p>For example, an appraiser might apply a higher weight to the value obtained with the sales comparison approach when the market is active with plenty of comparable properties. Alternatively, if the subject property is old and estimating depreciation is difficult, an appraiser might apply a lower weight to the cost method.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appraisal-based-indices">Appraisal-based indices</h3>
<p>A popular index in the United States in the NCREIF Property Index (NPI). Member of NCREIF, mainly investment managers and pension fund sponsors, submit appraisal data quarterly, and NCREIF calculates the return as follows: <span class="math display">\[
\\
\text{return} = \frac{NOI - \text{capital expenditures} + (\text{end market value} - \text{beg market value})}{\text{beginning market value}} \\
\]</span> Appraisal-based indices tend to lag actual transactions because actual transactions occur before appraisals are performed. Thus, a change in price may not be reflected in appraised values until the next quarter or longer if a property is not appraised every quarter. Also, appraisal lag tends to smooth the index; that is, reduce its volatility, much like a moving average reduces volatility. Finally, appraisal lag results in lower correlation with other asset classes. Appraisal lag can be adjusted by unsmoothing the index or by using a transaction-based index.</p>

<li>Lack of control</li>
<li>Costs of a publicly traded corporate structure</li>
<li>Price is determined by the stock market - While the appraisal-based value of a REIT may be relative stable, the market-determined price of a REIT share is likely to be much more volatile. Appraisals tend to be infrequent and backward-looking, while the stock market is continuous and reflects forward-looking values.</li>
<li>Structural conflicts of interest - When the opportunity arises to sell properties or take on additional borrowing, a particular action may have different tax implications for REIT shareholders and for the general partners, which may tempt the general partners to act in their own interest, rather than in the interest of all stakeholders.</li>

<li>Lack of flexibility - The rules that qualify REITs for favorable taxation also have a downside: REITs are prevented from making certain kinds of investments and from retaining most of their income. These limits may prevent REITs from being as profitable as they might otherwise be. REOCs, on the other hand, do not need to meet these requirements, and thus are free to retain income and devote those funds to property development when the REOC managers see attractive opportunities.

<p>NAVPS (net asset value per share) is the (per-share) amount by which assets exceed liabilities, using current market values rather than accounting book values. NAVPS is generally considered the most appropriate measure of the fundamental value of REITs (and REOCs). If the market price of a REIT varies from NAVPS, this is seen as a sign of over- or undervaluation.</p>

Capital expenditures related to maintenance, as well expenses related to leasing the space in properties, are subtracted from FFO because they represent costs that must be expended in order to maintain the value of the properties.</p>
<p>AFFO is considered a better measure of economic income than FFO because AFFO considered the capital expenditures that are required to sustain the property’s economic income.

<p>Dividend discount and discounted cash flow models of valuation are appropriate for use with REITs and REOCs, because these two investment structures typically pay dividends and thereby return a high proportion of their income to investors. For dividend discount models, an analysts will develop near-term, medium-term, and long-term growth forecasts and then use these values at the basis for two- or three-stage dividend discount models. To build a discounted cash flow model, analysts will generally create intermediate-term cash flow projections plus a terminal value that is developed using historical cash flow multiples.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="los-41.a-explain-sources-of-value-creation-in-private-equity.">LOS 41.a: Explain sources of value creation in private equity.</h2>
<p>The sources of this increased value are thought to come from the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>The ability to re-engineering the portfolio company and operate it more efficiently.</li>
<li>The ability to obtain debt financing on more advantageous terms.</li>
<li>Superior alignment of interests between management and private equity ownership.</li>
</ol>
<section id="re-engineering-the-portfolio-company" class="level3">

<p>Experienced industry CEOs, CFOs, and other former senior executives. These executives can share their expertise and contracts with portfolio company management.</p>
</section>
<section id="obtaining-favorable-debt-financing" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="obtaining-favorable-debt-financing">Obtaining favorable debt financing</h3>
<p>A second source of added value is from more favorable terms on debt financing. In PE firms, debt is more heavily utilized and is quoted as a multiple of EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) as opposed to a multiple of equity, as for public firm.</p>
<p>The central proposition of the Modigliani-Miller theorems is that the use of debt versus equity is inconsequential for firm value. However, once the assumption of no taxes is removed from their model, the tax savings from the use of debt increases firm value. The use of greater amount of financial leverage may increase firm value in the case of private equity firms. Because these firms have a reputation for efficient management and timely payment of debt interest, this helps to allay concerns over their highly leveraged positions and helps maintain their access to the debt markets.</p>
<p>According to this view, the requirement to make interest payments forces the portfolio companies to use free cash flow more efficiently because interest payments must be made on the debt.</p>
<p>Much of the debt financing for private equity firms comes from the syndicated loan market, but the debt is often repackaged and sold as collateralized loan obligations (CLOs). Private equity firms may also issue high-yield bonds which are repackaged as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).</p>
<p>A third source of value added for PE firms is the alignment of interests between private equity owners and the managers of the portfolio companies they own.</p>

<p>In many private equity transactions, ownership and control are concentrated in the same hands. In buyout transactions, management often has a substantial stake in the company’s equity. In many venture capital investments, the private equity firm offers advice and management expertise.</p>
<p>In private equity firms, managers are able to focus more on long-term performance because, unlike public companies, private companies do not face the scrutiny of analysis, shareholders, and the broader market. This also allows the private equity firms to hire managers that are capable of substantial restructuring efforts.</p>
<section id="control-mechanisms" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="control-mechanisms">Control mechanisms</h3>
<p>Private equity firms use a variety of mechanisms to align the interests of the managers of portfolio companies with the private equity firm’s interests.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compensation - Compensation that is closely linked to the company’s performance.</li>
<li>Tag-along, drag-along clauses</li>
<li>Board representation - The private equity firm is ensured control through board representation.</li>
<li>Noncompete clauses - Company founders must agree to clauses that prevent them from competing against the firm within a prespecified period of time.</li>
<li>Priority in claims - Private equity firms receive their distributions before other owners, often in the form of preferred dividends. They also have priority on the company’s assets if the portfolio company is liquidated.</li>
<li>Required approvals - Changes of strategic importance (e.g., acquisitions, divestitures, and changes in the business plan) must be approved by the private equity firm.</li>
<li>Earn-outs - There are used predominantly in venture capital investments. Earn-outs tie the acquisition price paid by the private equity firm to the portfolio company’s future performance over a specified time period.</li>

<p>Public companies are bough and sold on regulated exchange daily. Private companies, however, are bought by buyers with specific interests at specific points in time, with each potential buyer possibly having a different valuation for the company.

<p>To value private equity portfolio companies, many investors use market data from similar publicly traded companies, most commonly the price multiples from comparable public companies. However, it is often difficult to find public companies at the same stage of development, same line of business, same capital structure, and same risk. A decision must also be made as to whether trailing or future earnings are used. For these reasons, a relative value or market approach should be used carefully.</p>

<li>The return on the preference shares for the private equity firm.</li>
<li>The increased multiple upon exit.</li>
<li>The reduction in the debt claim.</li>

<p>In most LBOs, most of the debt is senior debt that will amortize over time. In the preceding example, the debtholders’ claim on assets was reduced from $600 to $250. The use of debt in this example is advantageous and magnifies the returns to the equityholders.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="appropriate-methods-for-venture-capital-valuation">Appropriate methods for venture capital valuation</h3>
<p>The pre-money valuation and investment will be negotiated between the investee company and the VC investor. Additionally, the VC investor should keep in mind that his ownership could be diluted in the future due to future financing, conversion of convertible debt into equity, and the issuance of stock options to management.</p>
<p>It is difficult to forecast the cash flows for a VC portfolio company. Discounted cash flow analysis (the income approach) is not usually used as the primary valuation method for VC companies. It is also difficult to use a relative value or market approach. This is because a VC company is often unique, and there many be no comparable companies to estimate a benchmark price multiple from. A replacement cost approach may also be difficult to apply. Alternative methodologies include real option analysis and the venture capital method.</p>
<p>To estimate the pre-money valuation, the VC investor typically examines the company’s intellectual property and capital, the potential for the company’s products, and its intangible assets.</p>

<p>An IPO usually results in the highest exit value due to increased liquidity, greater access to capital, and the potential to hire better quality managers. However, an IPO is less flexible, more costly, and a more cumbersome process than the other alternatives.</p>
<p>IPOs are most appropriate for companies with strong growth prospects and a significant operating history and size. The timing of an IPO is key.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="secondary-market-sale">Secondary market sale</h3>
<p>In a secondary market sale, the company is sold to another investor or to another company interested in the purchase for strategic reasons. Secondary market sales from one investor to another are quite frequent, especially in the case of buyouts. VC portfolio companies are sometimes exited via a buyout to another firm, but VC companies are usually too immature to support a large amount of debt. Secondary market sales result in the second highest company valuation after IPOs.</p>

<p>For example, if a portfolio company cannot be sold due to weak capital markets, the private equity firm may want to consider buying another portfolio company at depressed prices, merging the two companies, and waiting until capital market conditions improve to sell both portfolio companies as one.</p>
<p>When an exit is anticipated in the next year or two, the exit valuation multiple can be forecasted without too much error. Beyond this time horizon, however, exit multiples become much more uncertain and stress testing should be performed on wide range of possible values.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limited-partnership">Limited partnership</h3>
<p>The limited partners (LPs) provide funding and do not have an active role in the management of the investments. Their liability is limited to what they have invested. The general partner (GP) in a limited partnership is liable for all the firm’s debts and, thus, has unlimited liability. The GP is the manager of the fund.</p>
<p>Another form of private equity fund structure is the company limited by shares. It offers better legal protection to the partners, depending on the jurisdiction. Most fund structures are closed end, meaning that investors can only redeem the investment at specified time periods.</p>
<p>The private equity firm usually spends a year or two raising funds. Funds are then drawn down (capital call) for investment, after which returns are realized. Most private equity funds last 10 to 12 years but can have their life extended another 2 to 3 years.</p>

<p>The discount rate used and the estimate of terminal value will strongly influence the current valuation.</p>
<p>Projections by entrepreneurs are typically overly optimistic and based on an assumption that the company will not fail. Instead of arguing over the validity of the projections with the entrepreneurs, most investors simply apply a high discount rate that reflects both the probability of failure and lack of diversification available in these investments.</p>

<p>In summary, VC valuation is highly dependent on the assumption used and how risk is accounted for. Additionally, scenario and sensitivity analysis should be used to determine how changes in the input variables will affect the valuation of the company.</p>
<p>The purpose is to place some bounds on the value of the company before negotiations begin between the startup (investee) company and the private equity firm. The final price paid for the investee company will also be affected by the bargaining power of the respective parties.</p>

<p>Unlike stocks and bonds, commodities are physical assets, have no cash flows, and may incur storage and transportation costs.</p>
<p>Stocks and bonds (financial assets) can be valued by calculating the present value of their expected future cash flows. Commodities produce no earnings or cash flow; however, the current (spot) price of a commodity can be viewed as the discounted value of the expected selling price at some future date. Storage costs for commodities can lead to forward prices that are higher the further the forward settlement date is in the future.</p>

<p>Traders and investors in the commodities market can be classified as informed investors-those who provide liquidity to the markets-and arbitrageurs. Hedger are considered informed investors because they either produce or use the commodity. Hedgers reduce their risk by buying (going long) or selling (going short) futures contracts. A corn farmer can reduce the uncertainty about the price she will receive for her corn by selling corn futures. A cattle producer, however, would hedge his price risk by buying corn futures to reduce his uncertainty about the cost of feed for the cattle.</p>
<p>Speculators take on commodity risk in futures markets and may act as informed investors, seeking to exploit an information or information processing advantage to profit from trading with hedgers. Speculators can also earn profits by providing liquidity to markets: buying futures when short hedgers (commodity producers) are selling and selling futures when long hedgers (commodity users) are buying. - market making, liquidity 제공</p>
<p>Arbitrageurs in the commodity markets are often those in the business of buying, selling, and storing the physical commodities when the difference between spot and futures prices is too large or too small based on the actual cost of storing the commodity. When the difference is too large, an arbitrageur can buy and store the commodity and sell it at its (too high) futures price. When the difference is too small, an arbitrageur can effectively “not store” the commodity by selling from his own inventory and going long futures, replacing the inventory at the future date.</p>

<p>The difference between the spot (cash) market price and the futures price for a date in the future in referred to as the basis of the particular contract. The difference between the futures price of a nearer maturity and the futures price of a more-distant maturity is known as the calendar spread.</p>
<p>When futures price are higher at dates further in the future, the futures market (or futures curve) is said to be in contango. In a contango market, the calendar spread and basis are negative. Conversely, if futures prices are lower at dates further in the future, the market is said to be in backwardation, and the basis and calendar spread are positive.</p>
<p>When a future market is in backwardation, long futures positions have a positive return component. Since futures prices converge to spot prices over the term of a future contract, there is a positive returns component from the passage of time.</p>
<p>When a future market is in contango, there is a negative returns component for long futures positions. Convergence of futures prices to spot prices results in a decrease in the value of a long futures position.</p>

<p>Collateral return, price return, and roll return</p>
<p>If US Treasury bills are deposited as collateral, the collateral return or collateral yield is simply the holding period yield on the T-bill.</p>
<p>The price return or spot yield on an investment in commodity futures is the change in spot prices. <span class="math display">\[
\\\operatorname{price return} = (\operatorname{current price} - \operatorname{previous price}) / \operatorname{previous price}
\]</span> This process is referred to as rolling over the position and leads to gains or losses which are termed the roll return or roll yield. The roll return can be positive if the futures price curve is in backwardation or negative if the futures price curve is in contango. <span class="math display">\[
\\\operatorname{roll return} = \frac{\operatorname{price of expiring futures contract} - \operatorname{price of new futures contract}}{\operatorname{price of expiring futues contract}}

<p>In total return swap the swap buyer (the long) will receive periodic payments based on the change in the futures price of a commodity plus the return on the collateral, in return for a series of fixed payments.</p>
<p>The swap buyer instead may make a single payment at the initiation of the swap and then receive periodic payments based on the total returns, excess returns, or price volatility of a commodity, essentially “buying” exposure to the underlying risk factor.</p>
<p>In an excess return swap, a party may make a single payment at the initiation of the swap and then receive periodic payments of any percentage by which the commodity price exceeds some fixed or benchmark value, times the notional value of the swap. In months in which the commodity price does not exceed the fixed value, no payments are made.</p>
<p>In a basis swap, the variable payments are based on the difference between the prices of two commodities. Often two commodities are one that has liquid traded futures available for hedging and the other (the one the swap buyer actually uses in production) with no liquid futures contracts available. By combining a hedge using the liquid futures with a basis swap, the swap buyer can hedge the price risk he faces from the input that does not have a liquid futures market.</p>
<p>In a commodity volatility swap, the underlying factor is the volatility of the commodity’s price. If the volatility of the commodity’s price is higher than the expected level of volatility specified in the swap, the volatility buyer receives a payment. When actual volatility is lower than the specified level, the volatility seller receives a payment.</p>

<p>To be most useful, an index should be investable.</p>
<p>The available commodity indexes differ in the following dimensions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which commodities are included</li>
<li>The weighting of the commodities in the index</li>
<li>The method of rolling contracts over as they near expiration</li>
<li>The method of rebalancing portfolio weights</li>
</ul>
<p>While no index methodology will consistently outperform another index methodology, differences in methodology do result in returns differences, at least over shorter periods. Over long periods, differences between the mix and weights of constituent commodities in individual indexes will result in differences between returns, as some commodities outperform others.</p>
<p>Indexes may be equal weighted or weighted on some factor, such as the value of global production of an individual commodity or commodity sector. A production value weighted index will have more exposure to energy than to livestock or softs, for example.</p>
<p>With regard to roll methodology, a passive strategy may be a simply roll the expiring futures contracts into the near-month contract each month. A more active strategy would be to maximize roll return by selecting the further-out contracts with the greatest backwardation or smaller contango.</p>
<p>The frequency of rebalancing will also affect commodity index returns. Rebalancing portfolio weights will decrease return when prices are trending but increase returns when price changes are choppy and mean-reverting.</p>
<p>While differences in index construction methodology will lead to difference among index returns over relative shorter periods, no one methodology is necessarily superior over longer periods. Correlations between returns on different indexes have been relatively high, while correlations between commodity indexes and returns on stocks and bonds have been low.</p>
