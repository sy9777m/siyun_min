Calculate and interpret prices, income, and cross-price elasticities of demand and describe factors that affect each measure.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Elasticity is measured as the ratio of the percentage change in one variable to a percentage change in another. Three elasticities related to a demand function are of interest:
<ul>
<li>own-price elasticity = % change in quantity demanded / % change in own price</li>
<li>cross-price elasticity = % change in quantity demanded / % change in price of related good</li>
<li>income elasticity = % change in quantity demanded / % change in income</li>
<li>|own-price elasticity| &gt; 1 = demand is elastic</li>
<li>|own-price elasticity| &lt; 1 = demand is inelastic</li>
<li>cross-price elasticity &gt; 0 = related good is a substitute</li>
<li>cross-price elasticity &lt; 0 = related good is complement</li>
<li>income elasticity &lt; 0 = good is an inferior good</li>
<li>income elasticity &gt; 0 = good is a normal good</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="b.-compare-substitution-and-income-effects.">12.b. Compare substitution and income effects.</h3>
<ul>
<li>When the price of a good decreases, the substitution effect leads a consumer to consume more of that good and less of goods for which prices have remained the same.</li>
<li>A decrease in the price of a good that a consumer purchases leaves her with unspent income (for the same combination of goods). The effect of this additional income on consumption of the good for which the price has decreased is termed the income effect.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="c.-distinguish-between-normal-goods-and-inferior-goods." class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="c.-distinguish-between-normal-goods-and-inferior-goods.">12.c. Distinguish between normal goods and inferior goods.</h3>
<ul>
<li>For a normal good, the income effect of a price decrease is positive-income elasticity of demand is positive.</li>
<li>For an inferior good, the income effect of a price decrease is negative-income elasticity of demand is negative. An increase in income reduces demand for an inferior good.</li>
<li>A Giffen good is an inferior good for which the negative income effect of a price decrease outweighs the positive substitution effect, that a decrease (increase) in the good’s price has a net result of decreasing (increasing) the quantity consumed.</li>
<li>A Veblen good is also one for which an increase (decrease) in price results in an increase (decrease) in the quantity consume. However, a Veblen good is not an inferior good and is not supported by the axioms of the theory of demand.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="d.-describe-the-phenomenon-of-diminishing-marginal-returns.">12.d. Describe the phenomenon of diminishing marginal returns.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Marginal returns refer to the additional output that can be produced by using one more unit of a productive input while holding the quantities of other inputs constant. Marginal returns may increase as the first units of an input are added, but as input quantities increase, they reach a point at which marginal returns begin to decrease. Inputs beyond this quantity are said to produce diminishing marginal returns.</li>

<ul>
<li>Under perfect competition:
<ul>
<li>The breakeven quantity of production is the quantity for which price (P) = average total cost (ATC) and total revenue (TR) = total cost (TC).</li>
<li>The firm should shut down in the long run if P &lt; ATC so that TR &lt; TC.</li>
<li>The firm should shut down in the short run (and the long run) if P &lt; average variable cost (AVC) so that TR &lt; total variable cost (TVC).</li>

<li>Under imperfect competition (firm faces downward sloping demand):
<ul>
<li>Breakeven quantity is the quantity for which TR = TC.</li>
<li>The firm should shut down in the long run if TR &lt; TC.</li>

<ul>
<li>The long-run average total cost (LRATC) curve shows the minimum average total cost for each level of output assuming that the plant size (scale of the firm) can be adjusted.</li>
<li>A downward-sloping segment of an LRATC curve indicates economies of scale (increasing returns to scale).</li>
<li>Over such a segment, increasing the scale of the firm reduces ATC. An upward-sloping segment of an LRATC curve indicates diseconomies of scale, where average unit costs will rise as the scale of the business (and long-run output) increases.</li>

<ul>
<li>Under perfect competition, a firm’s short-run supply curve is the portion of the firm’s short-run marginal cost curve above average variable cost. A firm’s long-run supply curve is the portion of the firm’s long-run marginal cost curve above average total cost.</li>

<li>An increase (decrease) in demand will increase (decrease) economic profits in the short run under all market structures.</li>
<li>Positive economic profits result in entry of firms into the industry unless barriers to entry are high. Negative economic profits result in exit of firms from the industry unless barrier to exit are high.</li>

<ul>
<li>Whether a firm operates in perfect competition, monopolistic competition, or is a monopoly, profits are maximized by producing and selling the quantity for which marginal revenue equals marginal cost.</li>
<li>Under perfect competition, price equals marginal revenue.</li>
<li>Under monopolistic competition or monopoly, firms face downward-sloping demand curves so that marginal revenue is less than price, and the price charged at the profit-maximizing quantity is the price from the firm’s demand curve at the optimal (profit-maximizing) level of output.</li>
<li>Under oligopoly, the pricing strategy is not clear. Because firm decisions are interdependent, the optimal pricing and output strategy depends on the assumptions made about other firms’ cost structures and about competitors’ responses to a firm’s price changes.</li>

<ul>
<li>A concentration ratio for N firms is calculated as the percentage of market sales accounted for by the N largest firms in the industry and is used as a simple measure of market structure and market power.</li>
<li>The Herfindahl-Hirschman Index measure of concentration is calculated as the sum of the squared market shares of the largest N firms in an industry and better reflects the effect of mergers on industry concentration.</li>
<li>Neither measure actually measures market power directly. Both can be misleading measures of market power when potential competition restricts pricing power.</li>

<li>The IS curve shows the negative relationship between the real interest rate and levels of aggregate income that are equal to planned expenditures at each real interest rate.</li>
<li>The LM curve shows, for a given level of the real money supply, a positive relationship between the real interest rate and levels of aggregate income at which demand and supply of real money balances are equal.</li>
<li>The points at which the IS curve intersects LM curves for different levels of the real money supply (i.e., for different price levels, holding the nominal money supply constant) form the aggregate demand curve.

<li>The short-run aggregate supply curve shows the positive relationship between real GDP supplied and the price level, when other factors are held constant. Holding some input costs such as wages fixed in the short run, the curve slops upward because higher output prices result in greater output (real wages fall).</li>

<ul>
<li>The business cycle has four phases:
<ol type="1">
<li>Expansion: Real GDP is increasing</li>
<li>Peak: Real GDP stops increasing and begins decreasing</li>
<li>Contraction: Real GDP is decreasing</li>
<li>Trough: Real GDP stops decreasing and begins increasing</li>

Describe how resource use, housing sector activity, and external trade sector activity vary as an economy moves through the business cycle.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inventory to sales ratios typically increase late in expansions when sales slow and decrease near the end of contractions when sales begin to accelerate. Firms decrease or increase production to restore their inventory-sales ratios to their desired levels.</li>
<li>Because hiring and laying off employees have high costs, firms prefer to adjust their utilization of current employees. As a result, firms are slow to lay off employees early in contractions and slow to add employees early in expansions.</li>
<li>Firms use their physical capital more intensively during expansions, investing in new capacity only if they believe the expansion is likely to continue. They use physical capital less intensively during contractions, but they are more likely to reduce capacity by deferring maintenance and not replacing equipment than by selling their physical capital.</li>
<li>The level of activity in the housing sector is affected by mortgage rates, demographic changes, the ratio of income to housing prices, and investment or speculative demand for homes resulting from recent price trends.</li>
<li>Domestic imports tend to rise with increases in GDP growth and domestic currency appreciation, while increase in foreign incomes and domestic currency depreciation then to increase domestic export volumes.</li>

<ul>
<li>Neoclassical economist believe business cycles are temporary and driven by changes in technology, and that rapid adjustments of wages and other input prices cause the economy to move to full-employment equilibrium.</li>
<li>Keynesian economist believe excessive optimism or pessimism among business managers causes business cycles and that contractions can persist because wages are slow to move downward.</li>
<li>New Keynesians believe input prices other than wages are also slow to move downward.</li>
<li>Monetarists believe inappropriate changes in the rate of money supply growth cause business cycles, and that money supply growth should be maintained at a moderate and predictable rate to support the growth of real GDP.</li>
<li>Austrian-school economists believe business cycles are initiated by government intervention that drives interest rates to artificially low levels.</li>
<li>Real business cycle theory holds that business cycles can be explained by utility-maximizing actors responding to real economic forces such as external shocks and changes in technology, and that policymakers should not intervene in business cycles.</li>

<ul>
<li>A price index measures the cost of a specific basket of goods and services relative to its cost in a prior (base) period. The inflation rate is most often calculated as the annual percentage change in a price index.</li>
<li>The most widely followed price index is the consumer price index (CPI), which is based on the purchasing patterns of a typical household.</li>
<li>The GDP deflator and the producer or wholesale price index are also used as measures of inflation.</li>

<ul>
<li>Most central banks set target inflation rates, typically 2% to 3%, rather than targeting interest rates as was once common. When inflation is expected to rise above (fall below) the target band, the money supply is decreased (increased) to reduce (increase) economic activity.</li>
<li>Developing economies sometimes target a stable exchange rate for their currency relative to that of a developed economy, selling their currency when its value rises above the target rate and buying their currency with foreign reserves when the rate falls below the target. The developing country must follow a monetary policy that supports the target exchange rate and essentially commits to having the same inflation rate as the developed country.</li>

<ul>
<li>Free trade among countries increase overall economic welfare. Countries can benefit from trade because one country can specialize in the production of an export good and benefit from economies of scale. Economic welfare can also be increased by greater product variety, more competition, and a more efficient allocation of resources.</li>
<li>Costs of free trade are primarily losses to those in domestic industries that lose business to foreign competition, especially less efficient producers who leave an industry. While other domestic industries will benefit from freer trade policies, unemployment may increase over the period in which workers are retrained for job in the expanding industries. Some argue that greater income inequality may result, but overall the gains from liberalization of trade policies are thought to exceed the costs, so that the winners could conceivably compensate the losers and still be better off.</li>

<ul>
<li>A country is said to have an absolute advantage in the production of a good if it can produce the good at lower cost in terms of resources relative to another country.</li>
<li>A country is said to have a comparative advantage in the production of a good if its opportunity cost in terms of other goods that could be produced instead is lower than that of another country.</li>

<ul>
<li>The Ricardian model of trade has only one factor of production-labor. The source of differences in production costs and comparative advantage in Ricardo’s model is differences in labor productivity due to differences in technology.</li>
<li>Heckscher and Ohlin presented a model in which there are two factors of production-capital and labor. The source of comparative advantage (differences in opportunity costs) in this model is differences in the relative amounts of each factor that countries possess.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="e.-compare-types-of-trade-and-capital-restrictions-and-their-economic-implications.">17.e. Compare types of trade and capital restrictions and their economic implications.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Types of trade restrictions include:
<ul>
<li>Tariffs: Taxes on imported good collected by the government.</li>
<li>Quotas: Limits on the amount of imports allowed over some period.</li>
<li>Minimum domestic content: Requirement that some percentage of product content must be form the domestic country.</li>
<li>Voluntary export restraints: A country voluntarily restricts the amount of a good that can be exported, often in the hope of avoiding tariffs or quotas imposed by their trading partners.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Within each importing country, all of these restrictions will tend to:
<ul>
<li>Increase prices of imports and decrease quantities of imports</li>
<li>Increase demand for and quantity supplied of domestically produced goods</li>
<li>Increase producer’s surplus and decrease consumer surplus</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Export subsidies decrease export prices and benefit importing countries at the expense of the government of the exporting country.</li>
<li>Restrictions on the flow of financial capital across borders include outright prohibition of investment in the domestic country by foreigners, prohibition of or taxes on the income earned on foreign investments by domestic citizens, prohibition of foreign investment in certain domestic industries, and restrictions on repatriation of earnings of foreign entities operating in a country.</li>

<ul>
<li>The balance of payments refers to the fact that increases in a country’s assets and decreases in its liabilities must equal (balance with) decreases in its assets and increases in its liabilities. These financial flows are classified into three types:
<ul>
<li>The current account includes imports and exports of merchandise and services, foreign income from dividends on stock holding and interest on debt securities, and unilateral transfers such as money received from those working abroad and direct foreign aid.</li>
<li>The capital account includes debt forgiveness, assets that migrants bring to or take away from a country, transfer of funds for the purchase or sales of fixed assets, and purchases of non-financial assets, including rights to natural resources, patents, copyrights, trademarks, franchises, and leases.</li>
<li>The financial account includes government-owned assets abroad such as gold, foreign currencies and securities, and direct foreign investment and claims against foreign banks. The financial account also includes foreign-owned assets in the country, domestic government and corporate securities, direct investment in the domestic country, and domestic country currency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Overall, any surplus (deficit) in the current account must be offset by a deficit (surplus) in the capital and financial accounts.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>In equilibrium, we have the relationship:
<ul>
<li>exports - imports = private savings + government savings - domestic investment</li>
<li>When total savings is less than domestic investment, exports must be less than imports so that these is a deficit in the current account. Lower levels of private saving, larger government deficits, and high rates of domestic investment all tend to result in or increase a current account deficit. The intuition here is that low private or government savings in relation to private investment in domestic capital requires foreign investment in domestic capital.</li>

<li>If a forward exchange rate does not correctly reflect the difference between the interest rates for two currencies, an arbitrage opportunity for a riskless profit exists. In this case, borrowing one currency, converting it to the other currency at the spot rate, investing the proceeds for the period, and converting the end-of-period amount back to the borrowed currency at the forward rate will produce more than enough to pay off the initial loan, with the remainder being a riskless profit on the arbitrage transaction.</li>

<li>Exchange rate regimes for countries that have their own currency:
<ul>
<li>A currency board arrangement is an explicit commitment to exchange domestic currency for a specified foreign currency at a fixed exchange rate.</li>
<li>In a conventional fixed peg arrangement, a country pegs its currency within margins of +- 1% versus another currency.</li>
<li>In a system of pegged exchange rates within horizontal bands or a target zone, the permitted fluctuations in currency value relative to another currency or basket of currencies are wider.</li>
<li>With management of exchange rates within crawling bands, the width of the band that identify permissible exchange rates is increased over time.</li>
