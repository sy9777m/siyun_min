<ul>
<li>Descriptive statistics summarize the characteristics of a data set.</li>
<li>Inference statistics are used to make probabilistic statements about a population based on a sample.</li>
<li>A population includes all members of a specified group, while a sample is a subset of the population used to draw inferences about the population.</li>
<li>Data may be measured using different scales.
<ul>
<li>Nominal scale-data is put into categories that have no particular order.</li>
<li>Ordinal scale-data is put into categories that can be ordered with respect to some characteristic.</li>
<li>Interval scale-differences in data values are meaningful, but ratios, such as twice as much or twice as large, are not meaningful.</li>
<li>Ratio scale-ratios of values such as twice as much or half as large, are meaningful, and zero represents the complete absence of the characteristic being measured.</li>

<ul>
<li>Chebyshev’s inequality states that the proportion of the observations within k standard deviations of the mean is at least 1 - 1 / k^2 for all k &gt; 1. It states that for any distribution, at least:

<ul>
<li>Excess kurtosis is measured relative to a normal distribution, which has a kurtosis of 3.</li>
<li>Positive values of excess kurtosis indicate a distribution that is leptokurtic (fat tails, more peaked) so that the probability of extreme outcomes is greater than for a normal distribution.</li>
<li>Negative values of excess kurtosis indicate a platykurtic distribution (thin tails, less peaked).</li>
<li>Excess kurtosis with an absolute value greater than 1 is considered significant.</li>

Describe the issues regarding selection of the appropriate sample size, data-mining bias, sample selection bias, survivorship bias, look-ahead bias, and time-period bias.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Increasing the sample size will generally improve parameter estimates and narrow confidence intervals. The cost of more data must be weighed against these benefits, and adding data that is not generated by the same distribution will not necessarily improve accuracy or narrow confidence intervals.</li>
<li>Potential mistakes in the sampling method can bias results. These biases include data mining (significant relationships that have occurred by chance), sample selection bias (selection is nonrandom), look-ahead bias (basing the test at a point in time on data not available at that time), survivorship bias (using only surviving mutual funds, hedge funds, etc.), and time-period bias (the relation does not hold over other time periods).</li>

<ul>
<li>The hypothesis testing process requires a statement of a null and an alternative hypothesis, the selection of the appropriate test statistic, specification of the significance level, a decision rule, the calculation of a sample statistic, a decision regarding the hypotheses based on the test, and a decision based on the test results.</li>
<li>The null hypothesis is what the researcher wants to reject. The alternative hypothesis is what the researcher wants to support, and it is accepted when the null hypothesis is rejected.</li>

<ul>
<li>The test statistic is the value that a decision about a hypothesis will be based on. For a test about the value of the mean of a distribution:
<ul>
<li>test statistic = (sample mean - hypothesized mean) / standard error of sample mean</li>
</ul></li>
<li>A Type I error is the rejection of the null hypothesis when it is actually true, while a Type II error is the failure to reject the null hypothesis when it is actually false.</li>
<li>The significance level can be interpreted as the probability that a test statistic will reject the null hypothesis by chance when it is actually true. A significance level must be specified to select the critical values for the test.</li>

<ul>
<li>Hypothesis testing compares a computed test statistic to a critical value at a stated level of significance, which is the decision rule for the test.</li>
<li>The power of a test is the probability of rejecting the null when it is false. The power of a test = 1 - P(Type II error).</li>

Distinguish between parametric and nonparametric tests and describe situations in which the use of nonparametric tests may be appropriate.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Parametric tests, like the t-test, F-test, and chi-square tests, make assumptions regarding the distribution of the population from which samples are drawn. Nonparametric tests either do not consider a particular population parameter or have few assumptions about the sampled population. Nonparametric tests are used when the assumptions of parametric tests can’t be supported or when the data are not suitable for parametric tests.</li>
