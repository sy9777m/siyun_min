<ul>
<li>사람의 2 types of biases</li>
<li>remedy: training or accommodation</li>
</ul>
<p>Traditional finance focuses on how individual should behave. It assumes people are <strong>rational, risk-averse, and selfish utility maximizers</strong> who act in their own self-interests without regard to social values. Such individuals will act as <strong>rational economic men (REM)</strong>, which will led to efficient markets where prices accurately reflect all available, relevant information. Traditional finance is concerned with normative analysis and determining the rational solution to a problem. It uses prescriptive analysis to look for practical tools and methods to find those rational solutions.</p>
<p>Behavioral finance is descriptive, which focuses on describing how individuals actually behave and make decisions. Behavioral finance recognizes that the way information is presented can affect decision-making, leading to both emotional and cognitive biases.</p>
<p>This revealed many of the systematic biases in human decision-making.</p>
<p>the way of information presented = framing</p>
<p>Behavioral finance looks at normal behavior of <strong>individual market participants (Behavioral Finance Micro</strong>) and <strong>the effect of such behavior on markets (Behavioral Finance Macro)</strong>. A better understanding of the biases of clients (and of the professionals who work with those clients) should allow for the construction of portfolios that better approximate the efficiency of traditional finance and with which <strong>clients are better able to adhere to with during adverse conditions.</strong></p>

<h1>LOS 1.a: Compare and contrast cognitive errors and emotional biases.</h1>
<p>Rather than following the processes and steps of a rational economic man (REM), individuals use <strong>shortcuts, rules of thumb, and intuition (known as heuristics) to arrive at decisions quickly.</strong> Additionally, <strong>emotions and social influences affect decision-making.</strong> Cognitive limitations and emotional responses introduce bias into the decision-making process, leading to irrational behaviors and decisions. Behavioral finance assets that biases are not simply errors, which are <strong>random, but are systematic and therefore predictable.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cognitive errors</strong> are due primarily to faulty reasoning and could arise from a lock of understanding proper statistical analysis techniques, information processing mistakes, faulty reasoning, or memory errors. <strong>Such errors can often be minimized or mitigated with better training or information.</strong></p>
<p>cognitive errors는 잘못된 추론으로 인해 발생</p>
<p><strong>Emotional biases</strong> are not related to conscious thought and stem from feelings or impulses or intuition. As such they are more <strong>difficult to overcome and may have to be accommodated.</strong> When trying to overcome or mitigate biases that are both emotional and cognitive, success is more likely by focusing on the cognitive issues. (client’s biases)</p>
<p>You should <strong>always</strong> look at the combination of facts and information presented in any question to <strong>see if</strong> the bias in a particular situation is arising more from cognitive or emotional thinking <strong>before determining</strong> if it is likely it can be mitigated or if it must be accommodated.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cognitive-errors">Cognitive errors</h2>
<p>Cognitive errors can be divided into 5 “belief perseverance” biases that reflect a desire to stick with a previous decision and 4 “processing errors” where the information analysis process is flawed.</p>

<section id="conservation-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conservation-bias">Conservation bias</h3>
<p><strong>Conservation bias</strong> occurs when market participants <strong>rationally form an initial view but then fail to change that view as new information becomes available.</strong> Individuals may react slowly to new data or ignore information that is complex to process.</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of conservatism may include market participants who:</p>
<ul>
<li>are unwilling or slow to update a view or forecast for new information, and therefore <strong>hold an investment too long.</strong></li>
<li>portfolio를 바꾸지 않음</li>
<li>hold an investment too long to avoid the mental effort or stress of updating a view, when the new information is complex to understand.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more difficult the thought process or complex the information is, the greater the effort there is correctly updating prior beliefs. This effort is known as <strong>cognitive cost</strong>. The greater the cognitive cost associated with a new source of information, the less likely it is to be correctly processed.</p>
</section>
<section id="confirmation-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="confirmation-bias">Confirmation bias</h3>
<p><strong>Confirmation bias</strong> occurs when market participants <strong>look for new information or distort new information to support an existing view.</strong> Psychologists refer to the discomfort individuals feel when presented with information that is contrary to their beliefs as cognitive dissonance. (인지부조화) Subconsciously, human nature rejects this information to avoid the discomfort.</p>
<p>cognitive dissonance를 벗어나고자 하는 systematic effort</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of confirmation may include market participants who:</p>
<ul>
<li>consider positive but ignore negative information and therefore hold 1. <strong>investments too long.</strong></li>
<li>set up the decision process or data screens incorrectly to find what they want to see.</li>
<li>Underdiversify as they become overly convinced their ideas are correct, 2. <strong>resulting in concentrated positions. (underdiversify)</strong></li>
<li><strong>3. Over concentrated in the stock of their employer (treasury stock)</strong> believing they have an information advantage in to that security.</li>
<li><ol start="4" type="1">
<li>excessive turnover</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="representativeness-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="representativeness-bias">Representativeness bias</h3>
<p><strong>Representativeness bias</strong> occurs when the similarity of objects or events confuses individuals’ assessments regarding the probability of an outcome. <strong>Representativeness</strong> is based on a belief <strong>the past will persist and new information is classified based on past experience or classification.</strong></p>
<p>대표성의 오류 = classification error (분류의 문제)</p>
<p>→ systematic error → classify하고 나중에 가서 error를 인지하게 됨</p>
<p>소수의 법칙 - sample이 population을 대변하게 되는 현상, but sample is too small.</p>
<p>two forms of representativeness include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>base rate neglect</strong>, where the base rate (probability) of the initial classification is not adequately considered.</li>
<li>처음부터 classification criteria가 잘못됨</li>
<li><strong>sample-size neglect</strong> makes the initial classification based on an overly small and potentially unrealistic sample of data.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, a fund manager may show strong performance over a three-year time horizon. This may lead investors to assume this manager has superior skill. However, over a short time horizon, results may have arisen from luck rather than skill.</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of representativeness may include market participants who:</p>
<ul>
<li>attach too much importance to new pieces of information, or to a small sample. The impacts of such behavior can be <strong>excessive turnover</strong> based on short-term performance. The result can be excessive transaction fees and subsequent underperformance of the asset or fund that participants have switched to.</li>
<li>Make decisions based on simple rules of thumb and classification without thorough and more difficult analysis, which incur a high cognitive cost.</li>
</ul>
<p>Representativeness detection starts with a better understanding of the laws of probability and statistical analysis. By thinking in terms of probabilities, it is more likely risk will be considered and sufficient diversification will occur.</p>
<p>Long-term asset allocation should be implemented to create a diversified portfolio. A long-run perspective should be taken to avoid chasing short-term performance and excessive trading.</p>
<p>The following questions should avoid short-termism and ensure appropriate investments:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does the performance compare to similar portfolios (rather than to the general market alone)?</li>
<li>Have there been changes in the managers of the portfolio?</li>
<li>What is the general reputation of the manager?</li>
<li>Has the portfolio or manager changed style or investment approach due to changing conditions?</li>
</ul>

<section id="illusion-of-control-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="illusion-of-control-bias">Illusion of control bias</h3>
<p><strong>Illusion of control bias</strong> exists when <strong>market participants think they can control or affects outcomes when they cannot.</strong> It is often associated with emotional biases: illusion of knowledge (belief you know things you do not know), self-attribution (Belief you personally caused something to happened), and overconfidence biases (an unwarranted belief you are correct).</p>
<p>self-attribution, 자기기인오류</p>
<ul>
<li>내로남불, 잘 된 건 내 탓, 안 된 건 남 탓</li>
</ul>
<p>consequences and implications of illusion of control may include market participants who:</p>
<ul>
<li>trade more than is appropriate as they mistakenly believe they can control the outcome of a trade or are overconfident in their analysis.</li>
<li>excessive turnover</li>
<li>fail to adequately diversify because they analyze a narrow range of investments and fail to consider other investments and asset types.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="hindsight-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hindsight-bias">Hindsight bias</h3>
<p><strong>Hindsight bias</strong> is a <strong>selective memory of past events, actions, or what was knowable in the past, resulting in an individual’s tendency to see things as more predictable than they really are.</strong> Participants tend to remember their correct views and forget the errors. (systematic) They also overestimate what could have been known. <strong>Hindsight bias is sometimes referred to as the I-know-it-all-along phenomenon.</strong></p>
<p>후견지명, “내 그럴 줄 알았어”</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of hindsight may include market participants who:</p>
<ul>
<li>overestimate the rate at which they correctly predicted events which could reinforce an emotional overconfidence bias.</li>
<li><strong>Become overly critical of the performance of others.</strong></li>
</ul>

<section id="anchoring-and-adjustment-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="anchoring-and-adjustment-bias">Anchoring and adjustment bias</h3>
<p><strong>Anchoring and adjustment bias</strong> occurs when market participants use psychological heuristic experience based trial and error rules to unduly affect probabilities. <strong>Changes are made but in relation to the initial view and therefore the changes are inadequate.</strong> This makes it closely related to conservatism and a reluctance to change as new information is received.</p>
<p>수정 기준점이 문제가 됨</p>
<p>conservatism은 adjustment하지 않음, 그러나 anchoring bias는 adjustment를 하는데 잘못하는 것</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of anchoring and adjustment may include market participants who stay anchoring to an initial estimate and do not adequately adjust for new information.</p>
</section>
<section id="mental-accounting-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="mental-accounting-bias">Mental accounting bias</h3>
<p><strong>Mental accounting bias</strong> arises when <strong>money is treated differently depending on how it is categorized</strong>. For example a client might mentally treat wages differently from a bonus when determining saving and investment goals. Each mental account has its own budget and reference point and is viewed in isolation, rather than in the context of the individual’s entire budget. This behavior violates the traditional finances assumption that money is fungible and therefore interchangeable between accounts, and that investments are considered in the context of the entire portfolio.</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of mental accounting may include market participants:</p>
<ul>
<li>Structuring portfolios in layers to meet different priority goals. This may <strong>help</strong> clients overcome other biases. But it ignores correlation between layers of the portfolio and results can be suboptimal from a traditional perspective.</li>
<li>layering = pyramiding = goal-based investing (GBI)각 layer마다 correlation 무시, goal 중심유일하게 positive effect가 있는 bias</li>
<li>Failing to lower portfolio risk by adding assets with very low correlation.</li>
<li>Segregating return into arbitrary categories of income, realized gains and losses, or unrealized gains and losses. People tend to illogically distinguish between returns from income and capital gains. The tendency is to conserve capital gains but spend income. The result tends to be an overemphasis on income generating assets, resulting in a lower total return.</li>
<li>나이가 들수록 income-generating portfolio 선호income의 source를 구분하는 현상을 보임</li>
</ul>
<p>Mental accounting could be detected by examining what the portfolio could have achieved if the entire client assets were examined as one portfolio considering the effects of correlation among all parts of the portfolio. An excessive focus on source of return could be detected by analyzing the maximum total return consistent with the investor’s risk objective and constraints.</p>
<p>traditional finance - total return accounting</p>
<p>mental accounting - income source based</p>
</section>
<section id="framing-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="framing-bias">Framing bias</h3>
<p><strong>Framing bias</strong> occurs <strong>when decisions are affected by the way in which the question or data is “framed.”</strong></p>
<p>Consequences and implications of framing bias may include market participants who:</p>
<ul>
<li>fail to properly assess risk and end up overly risk-averse or risk-seeking</li>
<li>Choose suboptimal risk for their portfolio or assets based on the way presentation is made.</li>
<li>Become overly concerned with short term price movement and trade too often.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="availability-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="availability-bias">Availability bias</h3>
<p><strong>Availability bias</strong> starts with putting <strong>undue emphasis on the information that is readily available.</strong> Availability bias occurs when individuals judge the probability of an event occurring by the ease with which examples and instances come easily to mind. Ease of recall suggests that if something is easily recalled in memory, it must occur with a higher probability.</p>
<p>Availability bias can be further broken down into the following overlapping causes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Retrievability - If an idea or answer can be thought of quicker than others can, it is often chosen as correct, even if it is not.</li>
<li>Categorization</li>
<li>Narrow range of experience</li>
<li>Resonance (공명) - 내가 좋아하니 남도 좋아할 것</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences and implications of availability may include market participants who:</p>
<ul>
<li>Choose a manager or investment based on advertising or recalling they have heard the name.</li>
<li>Limit investment choices to what they are familiar with and fail to consider alternative investments, resulting in:</li>
<li>under-diversification inappropriate asset allocation</li>
<li>Overreact to recent market conditions while ignoring data on historic performance</li>
<li>Place too much emphasis on events that receive a large amount of media attention or advertising.</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems created by availability include overreacting and trading too much based on recent and easily available news or relying on available information or opinions that are of low quality and relevance. → Herding behavior, 뇌동매매</p>

<section id="loss-aversion-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="loss-aversion-bias">Loss-aversion bias</h3>
<p><strong>Loss-aversion bias</strong> arises from <strong>feeling more pain from a loss than pleasure from an equal gain.</strong></p>
<p>The conclusion is that individuals display asymmetrical responses to gains and losses. Kahneman and Tversky found that humans look at decisions as gains or losses relative to a reference rate. Anything below the reference rate is seen a loss, and above the reference rate a gain. → framing bias와 combined</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>reference point의 중요성 → framing bias에 노출</li>
<li>diminishing sensitivity</li>
<li>loss aversion (asymmetric response)</li>
</ol>
<p>Be sure to understand the difference between risk aversion and loss aversion. As a result, the individual is more likely to take risk in the hope of avoiding losses.</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of loss-aversion may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>To avoid having the pain of loss, an investment holder will <strong>tend to hold onto losers too long but may sell winners too quickly</strong>. This tendency is called the <strong>disposition effect.</strong></li>
<li>Trading too much by selling for small gains which raises transaction costs and lowers returns.</li>
<li>Incurring too much risk by continuing to hold assets that have deteriorated in quality and lost value.</li>
<li>If an initial decline in value occurs, then taking excessive risk in the hope of recovering.</li>
<li>Treating money that is made on a trade differently than other funds and taking excess risk with such money. (house money effect)</li>
<li>도박으로 딴 돈은 쉽게 쓴다.mental accounting bias</li>
</ul>
<p>Myopic loss aversion (MLA) combines loss aversion, mental accounting, and time horizon-based framing. Investors Benartzi and Thaler use MLA to explain the <strong>equity premium puzzle.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>equity premium puzzle - 주식의 risk premium이 이론 값보다 더 높은 현상</li>
<li>MLA - 단기손실회피 (myopic: 근시안적인)</li>
</ul>
<p>MLA argues that investors are loss averse and evaluate their portfolios too frequently. In the short term, losses are experienced more frequently than when examining performance over a longer time horizon. This short-term focus results in over reaction to short-term losses. The over-focus on short-term losses means that investors require high return potential on equities to justify investing in equity, and explains the equity premium.</p>
</section>
<section id="overconfidence-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="overconfidence-bias">Overconfidence bias</h3>
<p><strong>Overconfidence bias</strong> occurs when <strong>market participants overestimate their own intuitive ability or reasoning.</strong> It can show up as <strong>illusion of knowledge</strong> where they think they do a better job of predicting than they actually do. Combined with <strong>self-attribution bias,</strong> individuals will take personal credit when things go right (<strong>self-enhancing</strong>) but blame others or circumstances for failure (<strong>self-protecting</strong>). While it is both cognitive and emotional, it is more emotional in nature because it is difficult for most individuals to correct and is rooted in the desire to feel good.</p>
<p>Overconfidence arising from an illusion of knowledge is based a general feeling that the individual will be right. <strong>Prediction overconfidence</strong> leads individuals to underestimate uncertainty and standard deviation of their predictions while <strong>certainly overconfidence</strong> occurs when they overstate the probability they will be right. Consequences and implications of overconfidence may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Underestimate risk and overestimate return</li>
<li>Under-diversification</li>
<li>Excessive turnover and transaction costs resulting in lower return</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="self-control-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="self-control-bias">Self-control bias</h3>
<p><strong>Self-control bias</strong> occurs when <strong>individuals lack self-discipline and favor immediate gratification over long-term goals.</strong> The tendency for individuals to favor small payoffs now compared to larger payoffs in the future is known as hyperbolic discounting. (쌍곡할인)</p>
<ul>
<li>illusion of control bias - control 할 수 있다고 착각</li>
<li>long-term saving과 short-term consumption을 스스로 control 할 수 있다고 착각</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences and implications of self-control may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient savings accumulation to fund retirement needs, resulting from favoring current spending over saving.</li>
<li>Taking excessive risk in the portfolio to try and compensate for insufficient savings accommodation.</li>
<li>An overemphasis on income producing assets to meet shorter-term income needs.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="status-quo-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="status-quo-bias">Status quo bias</h3>
<p>Status quo bias occurs when comfort with the existing situation leads to an unwillingness to make changes. Status quo bias is caused by the interaction of loss aversion bias, endowment bias, and regret aversion bias.</p>
<ul>
<li>결과적인 bias, 원인 bias에 의한 현상</li>
<li>Do nothing, 현상유지오류</li>
</ul>
<p>Consequences and implications of status quo may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>holding portfolio with inappropriate risk</li>
<li>Not considering other, potentially better investment options</li>
</ul>
<p>Status quo is very hard to overcome so education regarding reasonable risk/return combinations and the danger of overconcentration in an (employer’s) stock is essential. (관성이 있기 때문)</p>
</section>
<section id="endowment-bias" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="endowment-bias">Endowment bias</h3>
<p><strong>Endowment bias</strong> occurs when an asset is felt to be special and more valuable simply because it is already owned. (소유효과)</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of endowment may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Failing to sell an inappropriate asset resulting in inappropriate asset allocation.</li>

<p><strong>Regret-aversion bias</strong> occurs when market participants <strong>do nothing out of excess fear that their actions could be wrong.</strong> Their sense of regret and pain is stronger for acts of commission, often resulting in inaction.</p>
<p>Consequences and implications of regret-aversion may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excess conservatism in the portfolio because it is easy to see that riskier assets do at times underperform. Therefore, do not buy riskier assets and you own’t experience regret when they decline.</li>

<p>The traditional finance perspective seeks to educate clients based on more quantitative measures of investing, such as standard deviation and Sharpe ratios, and these are of little interest to the client who reacts more emotionally to investing. The goal of viewing the client/adviser relationship from a psychological perspective as compared to a purely traditional finance is for the adviser to better understand his client and to make better investment decisions. By incorporating behavioral biases into clients’ IPS, clients’ portfolios will tend to be closer to the efficient frontier, and clients will be more trusting and <strong>satisfied</strong> and tend to stay on track with their long-term strategic plans.</p>

<p><strong>Status quo bias</strong> as investors do not make changes to their portfolio even when transaction costs are zero.</p>
<p>To counteract this inertia bias, some companies have autopilot options such as target date funds.</p>
<ul>
<li>inertia - 현상유지</li>

<p><strong>Naive diversification</strong> is when investors equally divide their funds among whatever group of funds is offered.</p>
<ul>
<li>1 / n diversification</li>
<li>regret bias로 인한 현상</li>
</ul>
<p>In either case some argue this is motivated by seeking to avoid regret.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive concentration</strong> in employer stock is also evident. This could be based on <strong>familiarity and overconfidence.</strong> If past performance has been good and you are familiar with it that would be <strong>naive extrapolation of past results</strong>. Framing and status quo biases can be found in pension funds where the employer matches employee contributions into the plan. <strong>Loyalty effect</strong> is imply a desire to hold employer stock as a sign of loyalty to the company.</p>
<p><strong>Excessive trading</strong> of holdings is evident in the brokerage account holdings of individuals, even though individuals show status quo in retirement funds. This could be due to <strong>overconfidence</strong> as the individuals think they have superior stock selection skills or <strong>self-selection</strong> as trading-oriented investors put their money in brokerage accounts and others put money in retirement portfolio at their company. Investors also show a <strong>disposition effect</strong> in selling stocks that appreciated but holding on to stocks that depreciate.</p>
<ul>
<li>disposition effect - 처분효과, 이익 난 건 빨리 팔고, 손해 난 건 물타기</li>

<p><strong>Home bias</strong> is seen in under diversification and failing to invest outside the investor’s home country.</p>

<p>pyramiding portfolio</p>
<p>Behavioral portfolio theory (BPT) assumes that investors construct their portfolios in layers, with each layer reflecting different risk and return expectations. The investor’s goals are then used to determine the allocation to each layer.</p>
<p>Five-Factor process:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Investor goals and the importance of each goal determine the allocation to each layer.</li>
<li>Asset selection will be done by layer and based on the goal for that layer.</li>
<li>The number of assets <strong>in a layer</strong> will reflect the investor’s risk aversion. Risk-averse investors will hold larger numbers of assets in each layer.</li>
<li>If an investor believes she holds an information advantage (has information others do not have), more concentrated positions will be held.</li>
<li>information ratio, benchmark와 다른 portfolio 평가지표 → information quality 평가</li>
<li>If an investor is loss averse, the investor will hold larger cash positions to avoid the possible need to sell assets at a loss to met liquidity needs.</li>

<ul>
<li>희망수준 이하로 떨어지지 않게 portfolio 구축</li>

<p>In the pyramid structure, the most pressing goals are placed on the bottom layer and are met using low-risk, conservative investments. Each successive layer going toward the top of the pyramid is made of riskier assets to accomplish less immediate or less important goals.</p>

<p>cognitive and emotional bias</p>
<p>There are several behavioral biases that contribute to overconfidence.</p>
<p>Analysts are subject to the <strong>illusion of knowledge bias</strong> when they think they are smarter than they are. The illusion of knowledge is fueled when analysts collect a large amount of data. Gathering additional information could add to an analyst’s overconfidence without necessarily making the forecast more accurate. The <strong>illusion of control bias</strong> can lead analysts to feel they have all available data and have reduced or eliminated all risk in the forecasting model; hence, the link to overconfidence.</p>
<ul>
<li>모르는데 안다고 착각</li>
</ul>
<p>Complex financial models can increase overconfidence and the illusion of control. Analysts should avoid <strong>reliance on a particular historic data set (representativeness)</strong> to avoid models that optimize the data set but perform poorly out of sample. A models’ performance out of sample is referred to as its robustness.</p>
<p>Exhibiting <strong>representativeness</strong>, an analyst judges the probability of a forecast being correct on how well the available data represent the outcome. (소수의 법칙)</p>
<p>An analyst exhibits the <strong>availability bias</strong> when he gives undue weight to more recent, readily recalled data.</p>
<p>To subconsciously protect their overconfidence, analysts utilize eco defense mechanisms. One ego defense mechanism is the <strong>self-attribution bias</strong>. (내로남불, good은 내 탓, bad는 남 탓)</p>
<p><strong>Hindsight bias</strong> is another eco defense mechanism. (기억의 편집, ‘내 그럴 줄 알았어’)</p>
<p>There are several actions analysts can take to <strong>minimize (mitigate) overconfidence in their forecasts</strong>. 1) <strong>Self-calibration</strong> is the process of remembering their previous forecasts more accurately in relation to how close the forecast was to the actual outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>population estimation = calibration → 스스로 자기 검증</li>
</ul>
<p>Analysts should also consider 2) <strong>sample size</strong>. (sample size의 limitation을 이해)</p>
<p>Lastly, Bayes’ formula is a useful tool for reducing behavioral biases when incorporating new information.</p>
<p>Bayes’ theorem allows you to update predicted probabilities of an event by incorporating new information using the following formula:</p>

<p>analyst가 주의해야 할 bias</p>
<p><strong>Framing</strong> refers to a person’s inclination to interpret the same information differently depending on how it presented. In the case of company information, analysts should be aware that a typical management report present accomplishments first.</p>
<p><strong>Anchoring and adjustment</strong> refers to being “anchored” to a previous data point.</p>
<p><strong>Availability</strong> refers to the ease with which information is attained or recalled.</p>
<p>Analysts should also look for <strong>self-attribution bias</strong> in management reports that is a direct result of the structures of management compensation packages.</p>

<p>Regret can lead investors to buy investments they wish they had purchased, which in turn fuels a <strong>trend-chasing effect</strong>. The <strong>disposition effect</strong>, which incorporates loss aversion, stems from overconfidence in mean reversion, resulting in selling winners too early and holding onto losers for too long.</p>

<p>Other studies have offered <strong>behavioral explanations, identifying the value and growth anomalies as a mispricing</strong> rather than an adjustment for risk.
