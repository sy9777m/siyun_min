<ul>
<li>The objective of financial statements if to provide economic decision makers with useful information about a firm’s financial performance and changes in financial position.</li>
<li>Reporting standards are designed to ensure that different firms’ statements are comparable to one another and to narrow the range of reasonable estimates on which financial statements are based. This aids users of the financial statements who rely on them for information about the company’s activities, profitability, and creditworthiness.</li>

Describe the International Accounting Standards Board’s conceptual framework, including financial qualitative characteristics of financial reports, constraints on financial reports, and required reporting elements.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The IFRS “Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting” defines the fundamental and enhancing qualitative characteristics of financial statements, specifies the required reporting elements, and notes the constraints and assumptions involved in preparing financial statements.
<ul>
<li>The fundamental characteristics of financial statements are relevance and faithful representation. The enhancing characteristics include comparability, verifiability, timeliness, and understandability.</li>
<li>Elements of financial statements are assets, liabilities, and owners’ equity (for measuring financial position) and income and expenses (for measuring performance).</li>
<li>Constraints on financial statement preparation include cost versus benefit and the difficulty of capturing non-quantifiable information in financial statements.</li>
<li>The two primary assumptions that underlie the preparation of financial statements are the accrual basis and the going concern assumption.</li>

<ul>
<li>Revenue is recognized when earned and expenses are recognized when incurred.</li>
<li>Accounting standards identify a five-step process for recognizing revenue:
<ol type="1">
<li>Identify the contract(s) with a customer.</li>
<li>Identify the performance obligations in the contract.</li>
<li>Determine the transaction price.</li>
<li>Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the cantract.</li>

Describe general principles of expenses recognition, specific expense recognition applications, and implications of expense recognition choices for financial analysis.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The matching principle requires that firms match revenues recognized in a period with the expenses required to generate them. One application of the matching principle is seen in accounting for inventory, with cost of goods sold as the cost of units sold from inventory that are included in current-period revenue. Other costs, such as depreciation of fixed assets or administrative overhead, are period costs and are taken without regard to revenues generated during the period.</li>
<li>Depreciation methods
<ul>
<li>Straight-line: Equal amount of depreciation expense in each year of the asset’s useful life.</li>
<li>Declining balance: Apply a constant rate of depreciation to the declining book value until book value equals residual value.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Inventory valuation methods
<ul>
<li>FIFO: Inventory reflects cost of most recent purchases, COGS reflects cost of oldest purchases.</li>
<li>LIFO: COGS reflects cost of most recent purchases, inventory reflects cost of oldest purchases.</li>
<li>Average cost: Unit cost equals cost of goods available for sale divided by total units available and is used for both COGS and inventory.</li>
<li>Specific identification: Each item in inventory is identified and its historical cost is used for calculating COGS when the item is sold.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Intangible assets with limited lives should be amortized using a method that reflects the flow over time of their economic benefits. Intangible assets with indefinite lives (e.g., goodwill) are not amortized.</li>
<li>Users of financial data should analyze the reasons for any changes in estimates of expenses and compare these estimates with those of peer companies.</li>
</ul>

Describe the financial reporting treatment and analysis for non-recurring items (including discontinued operations, unusual or infrequent items) and changes in accounting policies.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Results of discontinued operations are reported below income from continuing operations, net of tax, from the date the decision to dispose of the operations is made. These results are segregated because they likely are non-recurring and do not affect future net income.</li>
<li>Unusual or infrequent items are reported before tax and above income from continuing operations. An analyst should determine how “unusual” or “infrequent” these items really are for the company when estimating future earnings or firm value.</li>
<li>Changes in accounting standards, changes in accounting methods applied, and corrections of accounting errors require retrospective restatement of all prior-period financial statements included in the current statement. A change in an accounting estimate, however, is applied prospectively (to subsequent periods) with no restatement of prior-period results.</li>

<ul>
<li>Operating income is generated from the firm’s normal business operations.

<ul>
<li>basic EPS = (net income - preferred dividends) / (weighted average number of common shares outstanding)</li>
<li>When a company has potentially dilutive securities, it must report diluted EPS.</li>
<li>For any convertible preferred stock, convertible debt, warrants, or stock options that are dilutive, the calculation of diluted EPS is
<ul>
<li>diluted EPS = [(net income - preferred dividends) + convertible preferred dividends + convertible debt interest(1 - t)] / (weighted average shares) + (shares from conversion of conv. pfd. shares + shares from conversion of conv. debt + shares issuable from stock options)</li>

<ul>
<li>Common-size income statements are useful in examining a firm’s business strategies.</li>

<li>Assets are resources controlled as result of past transactions that are expected to provide future economic benefits.</li>
<li>Liabilities are obligations as a result of past events that are expected to require an outflow of economic resources.</li>
<li>Equity is the owners’ residual interest in the assets after deducting the liabilities.</li>
<li>A financial statement item should be recognized if a future economic benefit to or from the firm is probable and the item’s value or cost can be measured reliably.</li>

<li>The balance sheet can be sued to assess a firm’s liquidity, solvency, and ability to pay dividends to shareholders.</li>
<li>Balance sheet assets, liabilities, and equity should not be interpreted as market value or intrinsic value. For most firms, the balance sheet consists of a mixture of values including historical cost, amortized cost, and fair value.</li>

<ul>
<li>Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid financial assets that are readily convertible to cash. Their balance sheet values are generally close to identical using either amortized cost or fair value.</li>
<li>Accounts receivable are reported at net realizable value by estimating bad debt expense.</li>
<li>Inventories are reported at the lower of cost or net realizable value (IFRS) or the lower of cost or market (U.S. GAAP). Cost can be measured using standard costing or the retail method. Different cost flow assumptions can affect inventory values.</li>
<li>Property, plant, and equipment (PP&amp;E) can be reported using the cost model or the revaluation model under IFRS. Under U.S. GAAP, only the cost model is allowed. PP&amp;E is impaired if its carrying value exceeds the recoverable amount. Recoveries of impairment losses are allowed under IFRS but not U.S. GAAP.</li>
<li>Intangible assets create internally are expensed as incurred. Purchased intangibles are reported similar to PP&amp;E. Under IFRS, research costs are expensed as incurred and development costs are capitalized. Both research and development costs are expensed under U.S. GAAP.</li>
<li>Goodwill is the excess of purchases price over the fair value of the identifiable net assets (assets minus liabilities) acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but must be tested for impairment at least annually.</li>
<li>Under IFRS, debt securities acquired with intent hold them to maturity are measured at amortized cost. Debt securities acquired with the intend to collect interest payments but sell before maturity are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income. Debt securities acquired with the intent to sell them in the near term, as well as equity securities and derivatives, are measured at fair value through profit and loss.</li>
<li>IFRS permits firms to elect, irrevocably at the time of purchase, to measure equity securities at fair value through other comprehensive income, or any security at fair value through profit and loss.</li>
<li>Under U.S. GAAP, held-to-maturity securities are reported at amortized cost. Trading securities, available-for-sale securities, and derivatives are reported at fair value. For trading securities and derivatives, unrealized gains and losses are recognized in the income statement. Unrealized gains and losses for available-for-sale securities are reported in equity (other comprehensive income).</li>
<li>Accounts payable are amounts owed to suppliers for goods or services purchased on credit. Accrued liabilities are expenses that have been recognized in the income statement but are not yet contractually due. Unearned revenue is cash collected in advance of providing goods and services.</li>
<li>Financial liabilities not issued at face value, like bonds payable, are reported at amortized cost. Held-for-trading liabilities and derivative liabilities are reported at fair value.</li>

<ul>
<li>Under the direct method of presenting CFO, each line item of the accrual-based income statement is adjusted to get cash receipts or cash payments. The main advantage of the direct method is that it presents clearly the firm’s operating cash receipts and payments.</li>
<li>Under the indirect method of presenting CFO, net income is adjusted for transactions that affect net income but do not affect operating cash flow, such as depreciation and gains or losses on asset sales, and for changes in balance sheet items. The main advantage of the indirect method is that it focuses on the differences between net income and operating cash flow. This provides a useful link to the income statement when forecasting future operating cash flow.</li>

<ul>
<li>A firm that reports under LIFO must disclose a LIFO reserve, which is the difference between LIFO inventory reported and inventory has the firm used the FIFO method. LIFO reserve will be positive during periods of rising inventory costs and negative during periods of falling inventory costs.</li>
<li>A LIFO liquidation occurs when a firm using LIFO sells more inventory during a period than it produces. During periods of rising prices, this drawdown in inventory reduces cost of goods sold because the lower cost of previously produced inventory is used, resulting in an unsustainable increase in gross profit margin.</li>

<li>The impact of revaluation on the income statement depends on whether the initial revaluation resulted in a gain or loss. If the initial revaluation resulted in a loss (decrease in carrying value), the initial loss would be recognized in the income statement and any subsequent gain would be recognized in the income statement only to the extent of the previously reported loss. Revaluation gains beyond the initial loss bypass the income statement and are recognized in shareholders’ equity as a revaluation surplus.</li>

<li>A temporary difference is a difference between the tax base and the carrying value of an asset or liability that will result in taxable amounts or deductible amounts in the future.</li>
<li>A permanent difference is a difference between taxable income and pretax income that will not reverse in the future. Permanent differences do not create DTAs or DTLs.</li>

<ul>
<li>If it is more likely than not that some or all of a DTA will not be realized (because of insufficient future taxable income to recover the tax asset), then the DTA must be reduced by a valuation allowance. The valuation allowance is a contra account that reduces the DTA value on the balance sheet. Increasing the valuation allowance will increase income tax expense and reduce earnings. If circumstances change, the DTA can be revalued upward by decreasing the valuation allowance, which would increase earnings.</li>

<ul>
<li>Measurement of deferred tax items depends on the tax rate expected to be in force when the underlying temporary difference reverses. The applicable tax may depend on how the temporary difference will be settled (e.g., if a capital gains tax rate will apply). If a change that leads to a deferred tax item is taken directly to equity, such as an upward revaluation, the deferred tax item should also be taken directly to equity.</li>

<ul>
<li>Under IFRS, except for short-term leases, a lessee reports an asset and a liability on its balance sheet, both equal to the present value of the promised lease payments. The interest portion of each lease payment is reported as interest expense, while the principal-repayment portion of each payment reduces the lease liability. For short-term leases, rent expense is reported on the income statement and no balance sheet entries are required.</li>
<li>Under U.S. GAAP, a lease is classified as a finance lease if the benefits and risks of ownership have been substantially transferred to the lessee, or as an operating lease otherwise. Reporting for a finance lease is the same as under IFRS. For an operating lease, the entire lease payment is recorded as a lease expense while the principal portion reduces the lease liability.</li>

<ul>
<li>Under IFRS, there are two lease classifications for lessors, finance leases and operating leases. With a finance lease, the lessor removes the leased asset from its balance sheet and adds a lease receivable asset. The lessor reports the interest portion of the lease payments as income. for an operating lease, the lessor reports lease payments as income and depreciation and other costs are expenses.</li>
<li>Under U.S. GAAP, lessor classification for leases are sales-type, direct financing, or operating. A lease is sales-type if it meets the transfer of ownership criteria and collection of the lease payments is probable. A lease is direct financing if the transfer of ownership criteria are not net, a third party guarantees the residual value, and the lease payments plus the residual value at lease equal the fair value of the asset. A lease that is neither sales-type nor direct financing is an operating lease.</li>
