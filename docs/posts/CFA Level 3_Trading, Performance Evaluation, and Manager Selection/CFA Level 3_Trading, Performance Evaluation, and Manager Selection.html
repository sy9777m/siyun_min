<h1>LOS 25.a: Discuss motivations to trade and how they relate to trading strategy.</h1>
<section id="exam-focus" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="exam-focus">Exam Focus</h2>
<p>This topic review evaluates the trade execution component of the portfolio management process. Understand trade motivations, trade characteristics, and how these-in conjunction with market conditions-determine the most appropriate approach for a trade. Crucial to determining the optimal trading approach are the costs of trading, which are both explicitly observable (i.e., commissions and fees) and implicitly part of the trading strategy (i.e., execution cost and opportunity cost).</p>
<p>The four categories of trade motivation include the followings:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Profit seeking</li>
<li>Risk management and hedging needs</li>
<li>Cash flow needs</li>
<li>Corporate actions, margin calls, and index reconstitution</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Alpha decay</strong> is deterioration in alpha once an investment decision has been made. Managers with higher rates of alpha decay (e.g., managers trading on daily new flow) need to trade in shorter time frames; therefore, they have greater <strong>trade urgency</strong>. Other managers (e.g., managers with insights based on long-term company fundamentals) will have lower rates of alpha decay and therefore a lower trade urgency.</p>
<p>To minimize <strong>information leakage</strong> (i.e., alert the market to the security mispricing through their trading activity), managers may execute their trade in multiple venues. This may include less transparent venues called dark pools, which are trading systems with low pretrade transparency. Orders entered into a dark venue cannot be seen by other market participants before the trade occurs; hence, users know that there is no risk of information leakage. The disadvantage of dark pools is that traders can’t see orders on the other side of the trade, so they do not know the pretrade likelihood of execution. An execution venue with high pretrade transparency is called a <strong>lit venue</strong>. National stock exchanges are examples of lit venues.</p>

<p>Portfolios need to be traded to maintain targeted risk exposures. This may be simply rebalancing the portfolio after a change in market conditions (e.g., a fixed income manager targeting a fixed duration level), or hedging to remove a risk factor from a portfolio (e.g., an equity manager hedging foreign exchange exposure). Derivatives trades may be used to facilitate risk management; However, this does require that appropriate liquid derivative contracts exist and that the fund mandate permits their use.</p>

<p>These trades are primarily caused by investor subscriptions into, and redemptions out of, the fund.</p>
<p>Funds with less liquid holdings will find it difficult to invest new client funds in a short time frame. This may lead to cash drag, where the low returns of cash cause the fund to underperform the benchmark. To avoid cash drag, a manager may engage in equitization strategies where liquid securities such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or derivatives are used to gain market exposure while the investment in underlying securities occurs over time.</p>
<p>Client redemptions are usually based on the fund’s net asset value (NAV) using the closing prices of securities.</p>

<p>Corporate actions on portfolio holdings such as mergers, acquisitions, or spinoffs may require portfolio trading.</p>
<p>Margin calls on leveraged positions as well as derivatives positions that are suffering losses may require urgent sales of portfolio holdings.</p>
<p>When the benchmark index is reconstituted, managers may need to execute trades to reflect the change. This is particularly important for index-tracking funds. Since the value of the index benchmark usually is based on closing prices, trading at closing prices minimizes the fund’s tracking error to the benchmark.</p>

<p>These include side, absolute size, and relative size.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Side</strong> refers to the direction of the order (buy, sell, short buyback (cover), or short sell). A list of only buy orders or only sell orders will have greater market risk exposure compared to a list of buys and sells with offsetting market risk exposures.</li>
<li><strong>Absolute size</strong> refers to the number of securities being traded. larger orders will have a higher market impact cost than smaller orders.</li>
<li>With <strong>relative size</strong>, managers will often consider order size as a percentage of average daily volume (ADV). Orders that constitute a higher percentage of ADV are expected to have higher market impact costs.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Security type</strong>. Different security types [e.g., underlying securities, ETFs, American depositary receipts (ADRs), global depositary receipt (GDRs), derivatives, and foreign exchange (FX) contracts] trade in different markets with different costs, regulations, and liquidity.</li>
<li><strong>Short-term alpha</strong>. For active managers, a high rate of alpha decay requires a more urgent trade strategy. A manager will also have higher urgency in adverse market conditions (i.e., buying into a rising market or selling into a falling market).</li>
<li><strong>Price volatility</strong>. High price volatility implies high execution risk, defined as the risk that an adverse price movement will occur over the trading horizon.</li>
<li><strong>Security liquidity</strong>. Greater liquidity decreases execution risk and market impact cost. Narrow bid-ask spreads and large volume available for trading (i.e., market depth) are two key indicators of high liquidity.</li>

<p>Traders need to reflect changes of volatility and liquidity in their expectations. Lower liquidity suggests longer trading horizons; however, higher volatility might cause investors to speed up trades and incur higher costs to avoid execution risk of adverse price movements.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Decision price -</strong> 사기로 결정한 시점의 가격</li>
<li><strong>Previous close</strong> - This is the closing price on the previous day (often used as a proxy for decision price by quantitative managers using systematic rules-based, data-driven strategies).</li>
<li><strong>Opening price</strong> - This is the opening price on the day (often used as a proxy for decision price for subjective fundamental managers investing in securities for a long-term alpha, since it does not punish or reward traders for news released overnight when markets were closed). Note that if a trade is to be entered into an opening auction, which sets the day’s opening price of a security at a trading venue, then this opening auction price is not a good benchmark since it can be affected by the trade.</li>

<li><strong>Time-weighted average price (TWAP)</strong> - This is the equal-weighted average price of all trades executed over the trading horizon (i.e., TWAP ignores volume). TWAP may be appropriate for managers who wish to remove the impact of outliers (i.e., large trades that occur at the highs or lows of the day) since they believe they are less able to participate in these extreme trades. It is also appropriate in market environments with highly fluctuating volume throughout the day.

A drawback of this benchmark is the since the closing price is not known until after the trading is completed, a manager cannot assessing trading performance during the trading horizon.</p>

<li>Objective - invest new client funds (e.g., invest large amount with a mandate to track a small-cap index with a 3% tracking error). Performance measurement will begin at the current day’s closing price.</li>
<li>Urgency - liquidity is too low to execute in underlying securities by the end of the day, but immediate exposure is required by the client. Liquidity index futures contracts exist.</li>
<li>Reference prices - closing price</li>
<li>Execution method - obtain immediate exposure to index through a long position in index futures to eliminate cash drag. Build underlying stock positions over time to reduce market impact, while simultaneously unwinding the future position.</li>
<li>There are two issues with this method:
<ul>
<li>There may not be a closing auction for the futures contract, in which case the futures trade would need to be done as close to the market close as possible.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="high-touch-approaches">High-touch approaches</h3>
<p><strong>High-touch approaches</strong> involve high levels of human involvement. This is usually required for large trades (known as block trades), since finding the other side to larger trades is more difficult, or in less liquid markets. High-touch approaches include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Principal trades (broker risk trades)</strong> - This is where dealer or market makers assume all or some of the risk relating to executing the order, which is priced into their spread. <strong>Quote-driven, over-the-counter (OTC)</strong>, or <strong>off-exchange markets (</strong>real estate market이라고 생각하면 편함) are primarily principal trade markets. Principal trades also include <strong>request-for-quote (RFQ)</strong> markets where market makers do not provide continuous quotes, but only do so on request.
<ul>
<li>broker가 거래를 떠안음</li>
<li>Quote-driven market = price-driven market = dealer market → dealer가 주도</li>

<li><strong>Agency trades</strong> - This is where the broker finds the other side of the trade, and risk for order execution remains with the portfolio manager/trader.</li>

<li>too low liquidity</li>
<li>large volume</li>
<li>too urgent</li>

<section id="electronic-trading" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="electronic-trading">Electronic trading</h3>
<p><strong>Electronic trading</strong> involves trading via computer and is used in more liquid markets. Trading here is typically <strong>order driven</strong> in that electronic systems allow buyers and sellers to advertise their limit orders in a central limit order book. Electronic trading generally involves <strong>direct market access (DMA)</strong> and/or algorithmic trading. DMA allows buy-side portfolio managers/traders to access the order book of the exchange directly through a broker’s technology infrastructure.</p>
<ul>
<li>order-driven market = auction market</li>
<li>구매자 주도</li>
<li>DMA는 1) when urgent 2) small trades</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="algorithmic-trading" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="algorithmic-trading">Algorithmic trading</h3>
<p><strong>Algorithmic trading</strong> is the use of programmed rules to electronically trade orders, primarily used for two purposes: <strong>profit seeking and trade execution.</strong></p>
<p>Profit-seeking algorithms use real-time market data to determine which securities to buy and sell, and are employed by electronic market makers, quantitative funds, and high-frequency traders.</p>
<ul>
<li>좋은 가격에 거래 할 수 있을까?</li>
</ul>
<p>Execution algorithms trade according to the rule specified by the manager to meet their objectives.</p>
<ul>
<li>전부 체결할 수 있을까?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scheduled algorithms-percent-of-volume (POV), VWAP, and TWAP algorithms</strong>. These execute trades using rules driven by historical volumes or specified time periods.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>POV algorithms</strong> (a.k.a. participation algorithms) send orders according to a volume participation schedule (e.g., “participate as 5% of traded volume”).
<ul>
<li>Advantage: They automatically exploit increased liquidity when available.
<ul>
<li>cheap and efficient</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Disadvantage: They continue to trade at any (potentially adverse) price, and may not fill the order in a specified time if there is a lack of trading.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>VWAP and TWAP algorithms are <strong>time-scaling algorithms</strong>. VWAP algorithms attempt to match the VWAP price for the period by carving up the trade and sending orders based on <strong>historical</strong> intraday volumes. The usual intraday volume profile is to trade more at the open and close and less in the middle of the day. TWAP algorithms perform a similar task; however, they ensure an equal number of shares is traded in each time period (e.g., each hour).
<ul>
<li>Advantage - They ensure that a specified number of shares are executed in a specified time period.</li>
<li>Disadvantage - They may force trades in times of low liquidity or trade too little in times of high liquidity.</li>

<p><strong>Liquidity-seeking algorithms</strong> (a.k.a. opportunistic algorithms) aim to take advantage of favorable liquidity conditions when offered by the market. For example, for a buyer, this algorithm would wait until a larger seller appeared and then enter a market order. These order use both lit and dark venues.</p>
<p><strong>Arrival price algorithms</strong> seek to trade close to market prices prevailing at the time the order is entered. These algorithms will trade more aggressively (i.e., faster) than other algorithms to trade more shares at close to the arrival price.</p>
<p><strong>Dark strategies/liquidity aggregators</strong> execute trades in dark pools, with aggregator algorithms attempting to optimize trading across multiple dark venues.</p>
<p><strong>Smart order routes (SORs)</strong> are algorithms that determine the best destination (either lit or dark) to route an electronic order to get the best result. SORs focus on getting the best price for market orders, or the highest probability of execution for limit orders.</p>

<section id="equity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="equity">Equity</h3>
<p>Equities are usually traded on stock exchanges (lit markets) and dark pools. Equity markets are the most technologically advanced, with most of the trading executed electronically, and the use of algorithms is commonplace.</p>
</section>
<section id="fixed-income-markets" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="fixed-income-markets">Fixed-income markets</h3>
<p>Fixed-income markets tend to trade in a large number of heterogeneous securities, as many issuers have multiple issues outstanding. While the fixed-income markets tend to have low liquidity, typical order size is large. Due to these characteristics, trading is mostly conducted in dealer-based, quote-driven markets. Electronic RFQ systems are becoming more common; however, algorithmic trading is largely limited. Other fixed-income securities markets generally use high-touch execution methods-urgent trades would require a principal broker risk trade, while less urgent trades would use a broker-agent approach.</p>
</section>
<section id="derivatives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="derivatives">Derivatives</h3>
<p>Electronic trading is common for exchange-traded derivatives. Algorithmic trading is not as common as for equities markets, and is used more for futures than for options. Buy-side traders generally use DMA.</p>
</section>
<section id="otc-derivatives" class="level3">

<section id="spot-foreign-exchange" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="spot-foreign-exchange">Spot foreign exchange</h3>
<p>Spot foreign exchange trading takes place in OTC markets that use both electronic trading and high-touch broker approaches. The market works in three tiers: interbank, interdealer, and bank-to-client, with decreasing trade sizes and increasing spreads, respectively. For large urgent trades, RFQs are used with brokers. For large non-urgent trades, scheduled algorithms or high-touch agency approaches are used. Small trades are usually implemented using DMA.</p>

<p>Trading costs are either explicit in that they are easily visible (e.g., commissions and fees) or implicit in that they are embedded in the transaction (e.g., market impact/execution risk). Total costs of trading can be measured using <strong>implementation shortfall (IS).</strong></p>
<p>IS = paper return - actual return</p>
<p>The paper return is the return a hypothetical portfolio would have had if the trade were executed at the original decision price with zero cost. The actual portfolio return of the portfolio is net of all costs.</p>

</div>
<p><strong>Execution cost</strong> occurs due to executing shares at a less favorable price than the original decision price. Execution cost can be further broken down into delay cost and trading cost.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Delay cost</strong> is due to adverse price movements in the time between the portfolio manager submitting the order to the trader and the time the trader releases it to the market. This delay is usually due to the time it takes the trading desk to determine the optimal execution strategy for the trade.</li>
<li><strong>Trading cost</strong> is due to the market impact of executing the trade.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Opportunity cost</strong> is the cost of not trading any unfilled parted of the order.</p>
<p><strong>Fixed fees</strong> are any explicit commissions or fees incurred in executing the trade.</p>

<p>Trade cost analysis is vital for portfolio managers to be able to assess the effectiveness of brokers, algorithms, and other strategies.

<p>Regardless of the skill of the trader, buy orders in a rising market and sell orders in a falling market incur positive trading costs due to adverse price movement. To remove the impact of market movements on trade costs, traders can use <strong>market-adjusted cost</strong>.</p>

<li>Speed and likelihood of execution and settlement</li>
<li>Order size and liquidity</li>

<p>The BHB and the BF model attributions in the previous section were macro attributions. They looked at the value added through the decisions made by the sponsor to overweight/underweight different styles of <strong>manager</strong> versus the benchmark and the value added by the sponsor’s ability to select good managers in these styles.</p>
<p>Further down the investment decision-making structure are individual portfolio managers (either internal or external to the endowment) making decisions to overweight/underweight segments (e.g., substyle/sector/geography) of their portfolio to generate an active return. A performance attribution applied to these decisions made at the individual investment-manager level is called micro attribution.</p>
<p>Using the BF model, the allocation effect for a micro attribution calculates the allocation effect of the size bets made by the growth and value managers. Recall that the allocation effect is calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{allocation effect, } A_{i} = (w_{i} - W_{i}) \times (B_{i} - B)
\]</span></p>
<p>Recall that the selection effect is formulated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_{i} = W_{i} \times (R_{i} - B_{i})
\]</span></p>
<p>Recall that the interaction effect is formulated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
I_{i} = (w_{i} - W_{i}) \times (R_{i} - B_{i})
\]</span></p>
<p>The total allocation + selection + interaction effect is the total active return of the portfolio. Note that this is the same as the macro-attribution output.</p>
<ul>
<li>interaction, selection을 묶어서 계산하는 경우도 있음</li>
</ul>
<p>In later attributions, the reading presents the selection and interaction effect together rather than individually.</p>

<p>When the micro attribution is conducted on a single stock, the allocation effect actually represents the selection effect (because an allocation to a single security is really a stock-selection decision), and the selection effect represents the market timing and transaction costs of the manager with respect to the individual security.</p>

<p>regression analysis, exposure analysis</p>
<p>The <strong>Carhart model</strong> calculates the excess return from active portfolio management investment decisions by determining the impact on the portfolio due to the following factors: 1) market index (RMRF), 2) market capitalization (SMB), 3) book value to price (HML), and 4) momentum (WML)</p>

<p>Looking at the benchmark the sensitivity to RMRF of 1 suggests that the benchmark is a diversified index. The negative coefficient of the benchmark’s sensitivity to SMB indicates the benchmark has a large-cap focus tilt. We can summarize the benchmark as large-cap blend (no tilt toward growth or value) that does not use momentum.</p>
<p>To analyze the investment decisions by the portfolio manager, review column 1 (portfolio) and column 3 (different between portfolio and benchmark). The portfolio exhibits a value tilt but closely resembles the benchmark on the other factors.</p>
<p>The next step in the attribution analysis is to determine if the value tilt taken by the portfolio manager added or detracted value from the portfolio. From the factor sensitivities table, the value tilt contributed 1.29%, or over 78% of the total realized active return for the portfolio. The other effects were minor compared to the value tilt taken by the portfolio manager. Finally, the portfolio manager’s effectiveness at stock picking (security selection) detracted slightly (-0.10%) from the portfolio’s returns.</p>

<li>Convexity: 39 bps of active return was lost due to changes in the shape of the yield curve. Because the manager was overweight higher duration assets, this suggests that medium yield rose and short yield fell. This implies a steepening of the yield curve.</li>

<li>Shift - the impact of a parallel shift in the yield curve estimated through duration and convexity</li>

<p>The duration-based yield curve decomposition decomposes the active return of a portfolio manager to these sources of return. For example, a manager with an overweight position in high-coupon, high-yield corporate bonds will expect to have a positive contribution to active return from the yield component due to the high coupon and the spread component due to a presumed expected narrowing of the credit spread. Note that should their holdings default on coupons, or spreads in fact widen, then these effects would be negative, indicating that the manager lost value versus the benchmark due to the overweight position in high-yield corporate bonds.</p>

<p>Instead of estimating the impact of active bets using duration and yields to maturity, the full repricing approach breaks down the active return of the manager using individual spot rates for cash flows occurring at different maturity.</p>
<p>The full repricing approach breaks the active returns of the manager down to the individual cash flows that generated the active returns. As such, it is the most precise of the three fixed-income attribution methods and can accommodate the broadest range of instruments and yield curve changes. The drawback of the full repricing method is that it is the most complex method and, therefore, is least likely to be easily understood by the recipient of the output.</p>

<p>A more frequent benchmark in institutional investing is the liability-based benchmark, which is likely to be used by fund sponsors and portfolio managers when a firm has a specific liability to pay in the future. (e.g., a defined benefit plan). A liability-based benchmark focuses on the cash flows necessary to satisfy the liability and frequently limits the investment choices available to the portfolio manager (e.g., equity and fixed income only). Frequently used assets within a liability-based benchmark include nominal bonds, inflation-adjusted bonds, and high-quality stocks.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="hedge-funds">Hedge funds</h3>
<p>Three general types of benchmarks could be considered for hedge funds: 1) broad market indexes, 2) risk-free rate, and 3) hedge fund peer universes.</p>
<p>Broach market indexes are not appropriate to use as a benchmark for hedge funds because hedge funds cover a wide range of investment strategies. In addition, hedge funds differ significantly from each other and can have wide asset allocation fluctuations in the long term, which makes the use of broad market indexes problematic. With hedge funds using leverage, short positions, and derivatives-plus their overall lack of liquidity, transparency, ability to monitor, and low or no correlation of returns with the broad market index-broad market indexes should not be used as a benchmark for hedge funds.</p>
<p>The risk-free rate with an added spread could be used for some hedge fund strategies that focus on arbitrage. (risk-free rate is irrelevant to hedge fund) As a result, the spread would need to be increased accordingly. Finally, as with broad market indexes, the lack of correlation of hedge fund returns and the risk-free rate makes the risk-free rate on unsuitable benchmark.</p>
<p>Hedge fund peer universes are not suitable because a specific peer group’s risk and return objectives are not likely to match those of a specific hedge fund. Additionally, peer universes are subject to backfill and survivorship bias. Finally, because of the frequent illiquidity of underlying assets in hedge funds, current pricing may not be exact and may be based on an appraisal or prior period price.</p>
</section>
<section id="real-estate" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="real-estate">Real Estate</h3>
<p>Many real estate benchmarks exist but they are not all suitable for real estate investments:</p>
<ul>
<li>The benchmarks are derived from a sample of the real estate universe, which means they are not completely representative of the real estate asset class.</li>
<li>The performance of the index probably bears a very high correlation to the largest investments.</li>
<li>Benchmark returns are self-reported, so some subjectivity and/or bias may be present.</li>
<li>Benchmarks that are value-based could be biased toward the most expensive properties or geographical areas.</li>
<li>There is a lack of comparability with benchmark returns given that some benchmarks use leverage while others do not.</li>
<li>The indexes assume no transaction costs, full transparency, and normal liquidity, which is usually not the case; those factors would impact actual real estate returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, there is lack of consistency in the use of return measures. For example, the cash inflows and outflows for open-end funds are controlled by the investor, so time-weighted returns would be used. In contrast, the cash inflows and outflows for closed-end funds are controlled by the manager, so an internal rate of return (IRR) would be used.</p>
</section>
<section id="private-equity" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="private-equity">Private equity</h3>
<p>The metric used is usually IRR, taking into account all investment cash flows since inception plus the ending investment value. Key problems with such benchmarks include managers using different methods of valuation, which makes comparison more difficult. In addition, IRR may be biased by losses or gains occurring near the beginning of an investment.</p>
</section>
<section id="commodities" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="commodities">Commodities</h3>
<p>Benchmarks for commodity investments are usually based on futures as opposed to actual assets. This may result in significant differences between the benchmark and the commodity investments portfolio, which reduces the comparability.</p>
</section>
<section id="managed-derivatives" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="managed-derivatives">Managed derivatives</h3>
<p>Managed derivatives funds, often referred to as managed futures fund, use specific derivatives trading strategies to generate returns. Benchmarks are either strategy-specific or peer group-based. Peer-group benchmarks are similar those used for hedge funds and will potentially exhibit the same issues as hedge fund peer-group-based benchmarks such as survivorship bias.</p>
</section>
<section id="distressed-securities" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="distressed-securities">Distressed securities</h3>
<p>Given the illiquidity and severe lack of marketability of distressed securities, it is almost impossible to determine an appropriate benchmark. It is likely to require a significant amount of time to occur (if it even does) and that creates valuation problem (e.g., stable pricing).</p>
<ul>
<li>trade가 거의 없어서 real value와 market price의 괴리가 커짐</li>
</ul>
<p>They may take into account numerous strategies so that suitability of indexes for a specific strategy is questionable. As well, the indexes may perform valuations at erratic intervals so the issue of stale pricing may not be solved.</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[

<p>The Sharpe ratio is calculated as the incremental or excess return over the risk-free rate (numerator) divided by standard deviation (denominator). A key drawback with the ratio is that the denominator does not differentiate between volatility that is upside versus downside. Therefore, with the Sharpe ratio, there is a penalty for all volatility, even if it is “good” volatility.</p>

<p>The Treynor ratio is similar to the Sharpe ratio, but the denominator for the former is measured by beta, so it only considers systematic risk rather than total risk like the latter. Therefore, with the Treynor ratio, the universe of appropriate benchmarks is limited to only those that assume efficient markets. The Treynor ratio is only useful in evaluating portfolios that have systematic risk and do not have unsystematic risk; in other words, such portfolios are well diversified.</p>

<p>The appraisal ratio measures the ratio of active return to the volatility of the residual term, both derived from a factor-based regression.</p>
<p>A manager with a higher AR is generating more active return per unit of active risk (as represented by residual risk, also referred to the “standard error of the regression”) and is therefore a superior active manager according to this measure.</p>
<p>The standard error of the regression is the volatility of the error term in a factor-based regression. Hence, here is playing the role of active risk.</p>
<p>The AR is analogous to the information ratio-it looks at active return per unit of active risk. The only difference to the information ratio is that the AR uses a factor-based regression to estimate active return and active risk.</p>

<p>the Sortino ratio is more appropriate for investments with non-normal (nonsymmetrical) return distributions. Positively skewed and negatively skewed investment strategies would both result in lower Sharpe ratios (e.g., higher standard deviation in the denominator), but only the negatively skewed investment strategy would result in a lower Sortino ratio (e.g., high semi-standard deviation in the denominator). Therefore, for investments that have nonsymmetrical or skewed return distributions, such as hedge funds or options, the Sortino ratio appears to be a more appropriate performance metric. However, a comparability problem exists with the Sortino ratio because the determination of MAR is subjective and specific to each investor.</p>

<p>A capture ratio of 1 is indicative of a symmetrical return profile. Therefore, if the capture ratio &gt; 1, then there is positively asymmetrical (convex) return profile in that there is greater upside capture than downside capture.

<p><strong>Due diligence</strong> is the analysis and investigation in support of an investment decision, action, or recommendation. due diligence on investment managers must emphasize the sources and reasons behind the actual returns generated in the past. Then there must be an evaluation on the probability of repeatedly earning sufficient or better returns in the future using the same investment process.

<p>The manager universe consists of only those managers who are suitable for the portfolio in terms of the objectives and constraints of the IPS, invest in the relevant style (e.g., value, growth, mixed) desired by the client, and will manage the portfolio with the appropriate balance between active versus passive approaches.</p>
<p>At the manager universe stage, there should not be any performance assessment; that will occur later during quantitative analysis. Instead, there must be an emphasis on the manager’s risk profile and whether or not it is a good fit for the portfolio’s requirements.</p>

<p>Hypothesis testing can be used. The null hypothesis is that there is no value added, therefore, to demonstrate that it is value added on a statistically significant basis, the calculated test statistic would have to be large enough so that the null hypothesis would be rejected.</p>
<p>As a result, there could be a Type I error whereby the null hypothesis is rejected when in fact, there was no value added.

<li>not measurable</li>
</ul>
<p>Type I errors receive much more attention than Type II errors. One reason may related to the notion of regret aversion by the decision maker, which is linked to an error of commission (a Type I error). Errors of commission are active decisions that result in explicit (or visible)costs. In contrast, Type II errors are errors of omission, so they result in implicit or opportunity (less visible) costs. Another reason is that Type I errors are easier to determine; for example, a manager’s relative performance can be measured against a benchmark. Such performance also impacts the decision maker’s compensation so additional care would be taken to reduce the risk of a Type I error. In contrast, Type II errors are difficult to determine; for example, how can one objectively determine &nbsp;how a manager (who was not hired) would have performed? Finally, Type I errors are much more visible to clients who can easily determine that their investments have underperformed the benchmark over a specific time period, for example.</p>

<section id="costs-of-type-i-and-ii-errors" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="costs-of-type-i-and-ii-errors">Costs of Type I and II errors</h2>
<p>Type I errors result in costs associated with retaining managers who are weak, while Type II errors result in costs associated with not retaining managers who are strong. Therefore, assuming two separate groups of managers (e.g., strong and weak), the greater the differences in sample size and mean, the greater the costs of Type I and II errors. The wider the dispersion of returns between strong and weak managers, the easier it is to distinguish between their relative skills. Therefore, it makes it less likely to have a Type I or II error which results in a lower expected cost of a Type I or II error.</p>

</div>
<p>In an efficient market, the dispersion of return distributions between the two groups is probably smaller due to greater difficulty in achieving alpha through active management, which would lessen the costs of hiring or retaining weak managers (Type I error).</p>
<p>If markets are mean-reverting, then Type I errors may occur when firing a poor performer, only to have performance improve subsequently or hiring a strong performer only to have performance deteriorate subsequently (Note: That is not a Type II error because the assumption is that the poor and strong performers have been accurately determined initially but it is the mean-reversion of the markets that leads to the Type I error). Type II errors occur in mean-reverting markets when strong managers are fired or not hired (e.g., they subsequently underperform when the market goes down) or managers who have weaker short-term performance (but have sufficiently strong long-term performance) are fired or not hired and they subsequently outperform when the market goes up.</p>

<p>RBSA lacks precision since it essentially assumes that there is a static portfolio for the period.

HBSA uses a point in time analysis format that may not be useful in projecting into the future of if the portfolio has high turnover.

<section id="capture-ratios" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="capture-ratios">Capture ratios</h2>
<p>Capture ratios determine how suitable a manager is with respect to the investor’s risk tolerance and time horizon. The <strong>upside capture ratio (UC)</strong> looks at capture when the benchmark has a positive return. Based on the benchmark return, UC that is higher (lower) than 100% is indicative of outperformance (underperformance). Conversely, the <strong>downside capture ratio (DC)</strong> looks at capture when the benchmark has a negative return. Based on the benchmark return, DC that is lower (higher) than 100% is indicative of out- (under-) performance.</p>
<p>The <strong>capture ratio (CR)</strong> = UC ratio / DC ratio. The CR is a measure of return asymmetry, &gt; 1 = positive asymmetry (convex shape), and &lt; 1 = negative asymmetry (concave shape).</p>

<section id="drawdown" class="level2">

<p>In comparing a long-only strategy (100% invested in S&amp;P TR Index) versus a low-beta strategy (50% in S&amp;P TR Index, 50% in 90-day T-bills), it is quite possible for the low-beta strategy to outperform the long-only strategy on a risk-adjusted returns basis. In other words, a low-beta strategy may have lower absolute returns but the lower risk in the form of lower drawdowns may result in better risk-adjusted returns.</p>

<p>Therefore, those managers will execute passive strategies and attempt to earn risk premiums instead. These <strong>risk premiums</strong> are the returns that are earned above the risk-free rate for bearing undiversifiable risks, also referred to as systematic or market risk. To earn risk premiums, passive strategies will target one or more specific systematic risk factors including equity risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and volatility risk.</p>
<p>There are two broad types of inefficiencies to be considered: behavioral and structural. <strong>Behavioral inefficiencies</strong> are mispricings caused by other investors and their behavioral biases (e.g., trend-following). The mispricings are very short-term in nature and therefore, must be quickly exploited (sometimes within seconds) prior to the market correction. <strong>Structural inefficiencies</strong> occur because of laws and regulations which can make them long-term in nature.</p>

<h1>LOS 27.f: Evaluate the costs and benefits of pooled investment vehicles and separate accounts.</h1>
<p>Separately managed accounts (SMAs) and pooled investment vehicles are used to execute investment strategies. Pooled vehicles bring together the funds from all investors into one portfolio (e.g., mutual funds, ETFs, hedge funds) and there is no customization for any specific investor. SMAs hold the funds of one investor in a separate account so a key analysis is the cost-benefit trade-off of holding investments in a SMA.</p>
<p>Compared to pooled investments, SMAs have higher transaction costs but provide control, customization, tax efficiency, separate reporting, and greater transparency. The <strong>control</strong> is in the form of direct and legal ownership of the underlying securities by the investor. Therefore, there is extra protection given to the investor in case of a liquidity event or bankruptcy of the manager. As well, unlike pooled investments, the investor is not impacted by the redemption demands of other investors. In terms of <strong>customization</strong>, SMAs allow for the tailoring of client-specific objectives and constraints. <strong>Tax efficiency</strong> could be higher in SMAs because there is only payment of realized capital gains required. Investing strategies for SMAs can be tailored to minimize taxes paid by the individual investor. In terms of transparency, SMAs can provide an instantaneous snapshot or dashboard view of the investment holding at any given point. Polled investments may be able to do so but probably with a delay.</p>
<p>Customized SMAs require an extra layer of due diligence to evaluate security selection, portfolio construction, and operational issues.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="liquidity">Liquidity</h2>
<p>Closed-end funds and ETFs have the highest liquidity because they are traded intra-day. (listed) Open-end funds offer almost as much liquidity in that they are traded based on end-of-day NAV only.</p>
<p>Investments held in limited partnership structures (e.g., hedge funds, private equity and venture capital) usually involve investment capital that is tied up for more time. For example, hedge fund liquidity involves redemption frequency, lockup periods, notification periods, and gates.</p>
<p>Private equity and venture capital funds have the lowest liquidity because of capital calls; investors only receive returns after about five years into the 10-year average life of the funds. The manager may extend the life of the fund for up to two one-year periods, which further lowers liquidity.</p>
<p>Key advantages of limited partnership terms include ability to have a long investment horizon, thereby not allowing investors to overreact to short-term aberrations. As well, allowing for the earning of illiquidity premiums by investing in illiquid assets and not being forced to sell assets at depressed prices due to redemption requests.</p>

<p>An advantage of the investor paying fees based on AUM is that it rewards based on the manager’s skill and ability to grow the asset base. Many managers have declining percentage fees for larger accounts, so the AUM fee percentage is reduced with increased asset size, which reduces investors’ fees. Unfortunately, luck may play a significant role in the short-term growth of assets. Another disadvantage is that once the assets are attained by the managers, there is more incentive to retain the assets and earn the AUM fees (e.g., engage in safe strategies, such as indexing ) rather than take risks for the benefit of the investor.</p>
