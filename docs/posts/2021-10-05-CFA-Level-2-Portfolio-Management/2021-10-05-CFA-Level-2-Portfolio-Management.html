<p>Unlike open-end mutual funds, ETFs are traded on secondary markets.</p>
<p>The ETF issuer designates authorized participants (APs). APs are permitted to create additional shares, or redeem existing shares, for a service fee payable to the ETF manager.</p>
<p>The in-kind creation / redemption process serves three purposes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Lower cost</li>
<li>Tax efficiency</li>
<li>Keeping market prices in line with NAV</li>
</ol>
<p>This implies that ETFs should trade within a price band of the NAV, known as the arbitrage gap.</p>
<p>Investor -&gt; ETF (상장) -&gt; 추종하려는 Index (결국 ETF 가격은 Index 가격에 따라 움직임)</p>
<p>Authorized Participants (AP)라는 역할 존재</p>
<p>상장이니까 가격 변동성 존재 (NAV에서 가격이 멀어질 수 있음) -&gt; AP가 조절 by 증자, 감자</p>
<p>장점</p>
<ul>
<li>Lower Cost - 증자, 감자는 AP가 해주니 ETF Manager는 신경쓰지 않음</li>
<li>Tax Efficiency: ETF의 증자 / 감자는 비과세</li>
<li>NAV와 가격 같게 유지 -&gt; 그렇지 않으면 arbitrage gap 발생 가능</li>
</ul>

<p>In the United States, the National Security Clearing Corporation (NSCC) guarantees the performance of parties to a trade on an exchange. The Depository Trust Company (DTC), a subsidiary of NSCC, transfers the securities from the account of the seller’s broker to the account for buyer’s broker at the end of the two-day settlement period. Market makers, due to their special significance, and due to the time required by the creation / redemption process, are afforded up to six days to settle their trades.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="los-43.c-describe-sources-of-tracking-error-for-etfs.">LOS 43.c: Describe sources of tracking error for ETFs.</h2>
<p>Tracking difference is the divergence between an ETF’s return (based on its NAV) and the return on the tracked index. Tracking error is the annualized standard deviation of the daily tracking difference. Tracking error does not indicate whether the ETF under- or outperformed the index.</p>
<p>ETFs generally underperform the benchmark by their expense ratio.</p>
<p>Sources of tracking error include the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Fees and expense</li>
<li>Sampling and optimization</li>
<li>Depository receipts (DRs) - due to time zone differences in capturing price data</li>
<li>Index changes</li>
<li>Regulatory and tax requirements</li>
<li>Fund accounting practices</li>
<li>Asset manager operations</li>
</ol>
<p>Tracking difference: BM과 ETF return의 차이</p>
<p>Tracking error는 ETF가 Index보다 성과가 좋다 나쁘다 개념이 아님 - 잘 복제했느냐 개념</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="los-43.d-describe-factors-affecting-etf-bit-ask-spreads.">LOS 43.d: Describe factors affecting ETF bit-ask spreads.</h2>
<p>The primary factors affecting ETF spread are the liquidity and the market structure of the underlying securities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spreads on fixed-income ETFs tends to be larger than hose for large-cap equity ETFs.</li>
<li>The spreads are narrower during the overlapping time period when both markets are open.</li>
<li>Specialized ETFs, such as those that track commodities, volatility futures, or small-cap stocks, tend to have wider spreads.</li>
<li>Thinly-traded ETFs, regardless of the liquidity of the underlying, also command a higher spread.</li>
</ul>
<p>Maximum spread = creation (redemption) fees plus other trading costs + spread of the underlying securities + risk premium for carrying the trade until close of trading + AP’s normal profit margin - discount based on probability of offsetting the trade in secondary market</p>
<p>Bid-Ask spread가 영향을 미치는 주요 요인 - 해당 시장의 유동성, underlying security</p>
<p>채권 ETF spread가 더 큼, specialized ETF spread가 더 큼</p>

<p>The NAV of an ETF is generally its fair value.</p>
<p>ETF premium (discount) % = (ETF price - NAV per share) / NAV per share</p>
<ul>
<li>Timing differences - ETFs on foreign securities may experience gaps between the time the ETF is traded and the time when the underlying trades in a foreign market.</li>
<li>Stale pricing - Infrequently traded ETFs may reflect noncurrent prices and, therefore, their value may differ from NAV.</li>
</ul>
<p>ETF prices may be more informative than NAV or iNAV when 1) the market for the underlying is closed, 2) underlying securities are highly volatile or illiquid, or 3) there is a time lag between the pricing of the ETF and the pricing of underlying.</p>
<p>ETF는 일반적으로 fair value에 거래됨 - 거래소가 NAV를 공시</p>
<p>ETF premium = (ETF price - NAV price) / NAV price</p>

<p>ETF costs include management fees and trading costs.</p>
<p>Trading costs include brokerage or commission fees and bid-ask spreads.</p>
<p>For shorter holding periods, trading cost dominates the cost of ETF ownership. Conversely, long-term investors are likely to seek out ETFs with low management fees.</p>

<p>One method of estimating VaR is the parametric or vairance-covariance method. Assuming normally allows us to estimate the risk of the portfolio based only on the means, variances, and covariances (or correlations) of the various risk factors. (skewness and kurtosis)</p>
<p>Assuming normality, we can use the portfolio variance formula to estimate the mean and variance of portfolio returns. <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> lookback period - The important point is that the parametric estimates we use should be those we expect over the period for which we are estimating the VaR.</p>
<p>The parametric method is relatively simple to apply under the assumption of normally distributed returns. The length of the lookback period will affect the parameter estimates. In cases where normality cannot be reasonably assumed, such as when the portfolio contains options, the parametric method has limited usefulness.</p>

<p>Under the historical simulation method, no adjustment are made for the difference between the results for the lookback period and the results over a longer prior period.</p>
<p>One positive aspect of the historical simulation method is that we do not need the assumption of normality, or any other distributional assumption, to estimate VaR.</p>

<li>The concept of VaR is simple and easy to explain.</li>
<li>VaR allows the risk of different portfolios, asset classes, or trading operations to be compared to gain a sense of relative riskiness.</li>
<li>VaR can be used for performance evaluation.</li>
<li>When allocating capital to various trading units, a firm’s risk managers can also look at the allocation of VaR, and optimize the allocation of capital given the firm’s determination of the maximum VaR.</li>

</ul>
</section>
<section id="limitations-of-var" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="limitations-of-var">Limitations of VaR</h3>
<ul>
<li>VaR estimation requires many choices (loss percentage, lookback period, distribution assumptions, and parameter estimates) and can be very significantly affected by these choices.</li>
<li>The assumption of normality leads to underestimates of downside (tail) risk because actual returns distributions frequently have “fatter tails” than a normal distribution. Although the assumption of normality is not a requirement of VaR, it is almost always used, especially with the parametric method.</li>
<li>Liquidity often falls significantly when asset prices fall.</li>
<li>It is well known that correlations increases, or spike, during periods of financial stress. VaR measures based on normal levels of correlation.</li>
<li>While VaR is a single number that can be used to quantify risk, as with any summary measure, many aspects of risk are not quantified or included.</li>
<li>VaR focuses only on downside risk and extreme negative outcomes. Including consideration of right-hand tail values will give a better understanding of the risk-return trade-off.</li>

<p>Factor sensitivities can be used to estimate the effects of small changes in risk factors for these securities.</p>

<p>Banks typically use sensitivity measures (duration of held-to-maturity securities and foreign exchange risk exposure), scenario analysis and stress testing (for their full balance sheets), leverage risk measures, and VaR (especially for trading securities). Banks also estimate risk from asset-liability mismatches, estimate VaR for economic capital, and disaggregate risk by both geographic location and business unit type.</p>
<p>Traditional (long-only) asset managers typically focus on relative risk measures unless their goal is an absolute return target. A risk measure more specific to asset management is active share: the difference between the weight of a security in the portfolio and its weight in the benchmark.</p>
<p>Ex-post tracking error (backward looking) and ex ante tracking error (forward looking) measures provide different information. Ex-post tracking error is used for performance attribution and to assess manager skill over prior periods. Traditional asset managers mostly use ex ante tracking error for risk estimation. Managers with an absolute return target may use VaR instead.</p>
<p>For hedge funds, the risk measures used depend, to some extent, on the strategy employed.</p>
<p>Hedge funds with significantly non-normal returns distributions use a risk measure referred to as maximum drawdown: the largest decrease in value over prior periods of a specific length.</p>
<p>Defined benefit pension funds calculate the difference between the present value of their assets (often market values) and the present value of their estimated future liabilitieis (payments to retirees and heirs). A risk measure used by pension funds is surplus-at-risk, a VaR for plan assets minum liabilities.</p>
<p>Insurance companies are often subject to significant regulation of their products and their investment portfolios (reserves). Property and casualty insurers sell auto, home, boat, liability, and health insurance. Insurance risks are reduced by pruchasing reinsurance (from another insurance company) and by geographical diversification.</p>
<p>P&amp;C insurers use sensitivities of their exposures to market risk factors in their investment portfolios for risk management.</p>
<p>The insurance risk of life insurers is more highly correlated with the market risk exposures of their investment portfolios than it is for P&amp;C insurers. The present value of these liabilities are quite sensitive to the discount factors used.</p>

<p>Risk limits that are often imposed include following.</p>
<p>Risk budgeting refers to a risk management process that first determines the acceptable total risk for an organization, and then allocates that risk to different activities, strategies, or asset classes as appropriate.</p>
<p>Position limits are one way to limit risk because they ensure some minimum level of diversification by limiting risk exposures. For example, position limit may be imposed on allocations to individual securities within an asset class, asset classes such as equities or high-yield bonds, investments in a single country, securities in a single currency or the differences between long and short positions for a hedge fund manager.</p>
<p>Scenario limits are limits on expected loss for a given scenario.</p>
<p>Stop-loss limits require that a risk exposure be reduced if losses exceed a specified amount over a certain period of time.</p>

<p>Capital aalocation decisions refer to how the capital of a firm is used to fund its various business units or activities, analogous to asset aalocation for a portfolio manager. Risk management, however, requires that the risk exposure for each use of firm capital be considered.</p>
<p>One way to introduce risk exposures to various activities into the capital allocation decision is to limit the overall risk of all the activities.</p>

<p>The real risk-free rate of interest derives from the inter-temporal rate of substitution, which represents an investr’s trade-off between real consumption now and real consumption in the future. <span class="math display">\[

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risky-cash-flows-and-risk-premiums">Risky cash flows and risk premiums</h3>
<p>The risk aversion of investors can be explained by the covariance of an investor’s inter-temporal marginal rate of subsitution and expected on savings. Investors experience a large loss of utility for a loss in wealth as compared to a gain in utility for an equivalent gain in wealth. This property is called as risk-aversion.</p>
<p>An investor’s absoulte risk-aversion declines with their wealth; wealther investors are less risk-averse and more willing to take risk relative to their poorer counterparts. However, the marginal utility of holding risky assets declines as an investor holds more risky assets in her portfolio. <span class="math display">\[
\\P_{0} = \frac{E(P_{1})}{1 + R} + cov(P_{1}, m_{1})
\\R = \text{the real risk-free rate}
\]</span> The covariance between the expected future price of the bond and the investor’s inter-temporal rate of substitution can be viewed as a risk premium. For risk-averse investors, the covariance is negative; when the expected future price of the asset is high, the marginal utility of future consumption relative oto current consumption is low. Everything else constant, the lower current price(<span class="math inline">\(P_{0}\)</span>) increases expected return.</p>

<p>Active return(<span class="math inline">\(R_{A}\)</span>) is the value added by active management. Active return can be measured ex-ante or ex-post.</p>
<p>Active weights in a portfolio determine the amount of value added. Active weights must sum to zero.</p>

\]</span> An important attribute of the Sharpe ratio is that it is unaffected by the addition of cash or leverage in the portfolio.</p>
<p>The information ratio (IR) is the ratio of the active return to the standard deviation of active returns, which is known as active risk: <span class="math display">\[

<ul>
<li>The information ratio that we are considering is usually the ex-ante information ratio. The ex-ante information ratio is generally positive, while ex-post information ratios will often turn out to be negative.</li>
<li>A closet index fund is a fund that is purposed to be actively managed but in reality closely tracks the underlying benchmark index. These funds will have a Sharpe ratio similar to that of the benchmark index, a very low information ratio, and little active risk. After fees, the information ratio of a closet index fund is often negative.</li>
<li>A fund with zero systematic risk that uses the risk-free rate as its benchmark would have an information ratio that is equal to its Sharpe ratio.</li>
<li>Unlike the Sharpe ratio, the information ratio will change with the addition of cash or the use of leverage. Adding cash to a portfolio is likely to lower active return.</li>
<li>The information ratio of an unconstrained portfolio is unaffected by the aggressiveness of the active weights. If the active weights of a portfolio are tripled, the active return and the active risk both triple, leaving the information ratio unchanged.</li>
<li>The resulting blended portfolio will have the same information ratio as the original actively managed portfolio, leaving the information ratio unchanged.</li>
<li>Investors can select an appropriate amount of active risk by investing a portion of their assets in the active portfolio and the remaining portion in the benchmark.</li>
</ul>
<p>For an unconstrained active portfolio, the optimal amount of active risk is the level of active risk that maximizes the portfolio’s Sharpe ratio. This optimal amount of active risk can be calculated as: <span class="math display">\[

<p>The practical limitations of the fundamental law of active management can be summarized as “garbage in, garbage out;” poor input estimates lead to incorrect evaluations. In the case of unconstrained optimization, the two components (inputs) that determine the information ratio are 1) the information coefficient (IC) and 2) the breadth (BR) of the manager’s strategy.</p>
<p>The limitations are generally derived from inaccurate estimates of the two inputs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ex-ante measurement of skill - Managers tend to overestimate their ability to outperform the market and, hence, overestimate their IC.</li>
<li>Independence - If two or more decisions rely on same (or similar) information, then they are not independent.</li>
