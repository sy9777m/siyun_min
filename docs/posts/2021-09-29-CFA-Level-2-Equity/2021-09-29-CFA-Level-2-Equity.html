<p>One absolute valuation approach is to determine the value of a firm today as the discounted or present value of all the cash flows expected in the future.</p>
<p>Another absolute approach to valuation is represented by asset-based models. This approach estimates a firm’s value as the sum of the market value of the assets it owns or controls. This approach is commonly used to value firms that own or control natural resources, such as oil fields, coal deposits, and other mineral claims.</p>

<p>equity risk premium = required return on equity index - risk-free rate</p>
<section id="historical-estimates" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="historical-estimates">Historical estimates</h3>
<p>A historical estimate of the equity risk premium consists of the difference between the historical mean return for a broad-based equity-market index and a risk-free rate over a given time period.</p>
<p>A weakness of the approach is the assumption that the mean and variance of the returns are constant over time. In fact, the premium actually appears to be countercyclical-it is low during good times and high during bad times.</p>
<p>The historical estimate can also be upward biased if only firms that have survived during the period of measurement (called survivorship bias) are included in the sample.</p>
<p>The risk premium is always be lower when the geometric mean is used instead of the arithmetic mean. If the yield curve is upward sloping, the use of longer-term bonds rather than shorter-term bonds to estimate the risk-free rate will cause the estimated risk premium to be smaller.</p>

<p>A weakness of the approach is that the forward-looking estimates will change through time and need to be updated.</p>

<li>Confidence risk - unexpected changes in the difference between the return of risky corporate bonds and government bonds.</li>
<li>Time horizon risk - unexpected change in the difference between the return of long-term government bonds and Treasury bills.</li>

<p>The ownership perspective in the free cash flow approach is that of an acquirer who can change the firm’s dividend policy, which is a control perspective, or for minority shareholders of a company that is in-play. The ownership perspective implicit in the dividend discount approach is that of a minority owner who has no direct control over the firm’s dividend policy.</p>
<p>Analysts often prefer to use free cash flow rather than dividend-based valuation for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>many firms pay no, or low, cash dividends</li>
<li>Dividends are paid at the discretion of the board of directors. It may consequently, be poorly aligned with the firm’s long-run profitability.</li>

<p>The most significant noncash charge is usually depreciation.</p>
<ul>
<li>Amortization of intangibles should be added back to net income, much like depreciation.</li>
<li>Provisions for restructuring charges and other noncash losses should be added back to net income. However, if the firm is accruing these costs to cover future cash outflows, then the forecast of future free cash flow should be reduced accordingly. Gains or losses on sale of long-term assets are also removed (they would be accounted for under fixed capital investment).</li>
<li>Income from restructuring charge reversals and other noncash gains should be subtracted from net income.</li>
<li>For a bond issuer, the amortization of a bond discount should be added back to net income, and the accretion of the bond premium should be subtracted from net income to calculate FCFF.</li>
<li>Deferred taxes, which result from differences in the timing of reporting income and expenses for accounting versus tax purposes, must be carefully analyzed. Over time, differences between book and taxable income should offset each other and have no significant effect on overall cash flows. If, however, the analyst expects deferred tax liabilities to continue to increase, increases in deferred tax liabilities should be added back to net income. Increases in deferred tax assets that are not expected to reverse should be subtracted from net income.</li>

<p>Remember to treat preferred stock just like debt, except preferred dividends are not tax deductible.</p>
<p>Specifically, any preferred dividends should be added back to the FCFF, just as after-tax interest charges are in the net income approach to generating FCFF. This approach assumes that net income is net income to common shareholders after preferred dividends have been subtracted out. The only adjustment to FCFE would be to modify net borrowing to reflect new debt borrowing and net issuance by the amount of the preferred stock.</p>

<p><strong>A justified price multiple</strong> is what the multiple should be if the stock is fairly valued.

<section id="pe-ratio" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="pe-ratio">P/E ratio</h3>
<p>There are a number of rationales for using price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio in valuation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earnings power, as measured by earnings per share (EPS), is the primary determinant of investment value.</li>
<li>The P/E ratio is popular in the investment community.</li>
<li>Empirical research shows that P/E differences are significantly related to long-run average stock returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>P/E ratio have a number of shortcomings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Earnings can be negative, which produces a meaningless P/E ratio.</li>
<li>The volatile, transitory portion of earnings makes the interpretation of P/Es diffciult for analysts.</li>
<li>Management discretion within allowed accounting practices can distort reported earnings, and thereby lessen the comparability of P/Es across firms.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="./image-20210929001135503.png" class="img-fluid" alt="image-20210929001135503"> <span class="math display">\[

</div>
<p>Advantages of using the price-to-book (P/B) ratio include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Book value is a cumulative amount that is usually positive, even when the firm reports a loss and EPS is negative. Thus, a P/B can typically be used when P/E cannot.</li>
<li>Book value is more stable than EPS, so it may be more useful than P/E when EPS is particularly high, low, or volatile.</li>
<li>Book value is an appropriate measure of net asset value for firms that primarily hold liquid assets. Examples include finance, investment, insurance, and banking firms.</li>
<li>P/B can be useful in valuing companies that are expected to go out of business.</li>
<li>Empirical research shows that P/Bs help explain differences in long-run average stock return.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages of using P/B include:</p>
<ul>
<li>P/Bs do not reflect the value of intangible economic assets, such as human capital.</li>
<li>P/Bs can be misleading when there are significant differences in the asset size of the firms under consideration because in some cases the firm’s business model dictates the size of its asset base.</li>
<li>Different accounting conventions can obscure the true investment in the firm made by shareholders, which reduces the comparability of P/Bs across firms and countries.</li>
<li>Inflation and technological change can cause the book and market values of assets to differ significantly, so book value is not an accurate measure of the value of shareholders’ investment.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\\\operatorname{P/B\, ratio} = \frac{\operatorname{market value of equity}}{\operatorname{book value of equity}} = \frac{\operatorname{market price per share}}{\operatorname{book value per share}}
\\\operatorname{book value of equity} = \operatorname{common\, shareholders'\, equity} = \operatorname{total assets} - \operatorname{total liabilities} - \operatorname{preferred stock}\\
\]</span></p>
<p>A common adjustment is to use tangible book value, which is equal to book value of equity less intangible assets. Balance sheets should be adjusted for significant off-balance-sheet assets and liabilities and for differences between the fair and recorded value of assets and liabilities. Finally, book values often need to be adjusted to ensure comparability.</p>

<li>Sales revenue is always positive.</li>
<li>Sales revenue is not as easy to manipulate.</li>
<li>P/S ratios are not as volatile as P/E multiples.</li>
<li>P/S ratios are particularly appropriate for valuing stocks in mature or cyclical industries and start-up companies with no record of earnings.</li>

<ul>
<li>High growth in sales does not necessarily indicate high operating profits as measured by earnings and cash flow.</li>

<ul>
<li>Cash flow is harder for managers to manipulate than earnings.</li>
<li>Price to cash flow is more stable than price to earnings.</li>
<li>Reliance on cash flow rather than earnings handles the problem of differences in the quality of reported earnings, which is problem for P/E.</li>
<li>Empirical evidence indicates that differences in price to cash flow are significantly related to differences in long-run average stock returns.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are two drawbacks to the price-to-cash flow ratio:</p>
<ul>
<li>Items affecting actual cash flow from operations are ignored when the EPs plus noncash charges estimate is used. For example, noncash revenue and net changes in working capital are ignored.</li>
<li>From a theoretical perspective, free cash flow to equity (FCFE) is preferable to operating cash flow. However, FCFE is more volatile than operating cash flow, so it is not necessarily more informative.</li>

<p>Disadvantages of the dividend yield approach include:</p>

<p>There are at least four definitions of cash flow available for use</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Earnings-plus-non-cash-charges (CF) <span class="math display">\[
\\CF = \operatorname{net income} + depreciation + amortization
\]</span></p>
<ul>
<li>It ignores some items that affect cash flow, such as noncash revenue and changes in net working capital.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Adjusted cash flow (adjusted CFO)</p>
<ul>
<li>CFO is often adjusted for nonrecurring cash flows. US GAAP requires interest paid, interest received, and dividends received to be classified as operating cash flows. IFRS, however, is more flexible: interest paid may be classified as either an operating or financing cash flow, while interest and dividends received can be classified as either operating or investing cash flows.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Free cash flow to equity (FCFE)</p>
<ul>
<li>Theory suggests that FCFE is the preferred way to define cash flow, but it is more volatile than straight cash flow. <span class="math display">\[
\\FCFE = CFO - FCInv + \operatorname{net borrowing}
\]</span></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA)</p>
<ul>
<li>EBITDA is a pretax, pre-interest measure that represents a flow to both equity and debt. Thus, it is better suited as an indicator of total company value than just equity value. Enterprise value-to-EBITDA ratio.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<p>The rationale for subtracting cash and investments is that an acquirer’s net price paid for an acquisition target would be lower by the amount of the target’s liquid assets. <span class="math display">\[
\\\operatorname{EV/EBITDA\, ratio} = \frac{\operatorname{enterprise value}}{EBITDA}
\]</span> EV/EBITDA is useful in a number of situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ratio may be more useful than P/E when comparing firms with different degrees of financial leverage.</li>
<li>EBITDA is useful for valuing capital-intensive businesses with high levels of depreciation and amortization.</li>
<li>EBITDA is usually positive even when EPS is not.</li>
</ul>
<p>EV/EBITDA has a number of drawbacks, however:</p>
<ul>
<li>If working capital is growing, EBITDA will overstate CFO.</li>
<li>Because FCFF captures the amount of capital expenditures, it is more strongly linked with valuation theory than EBITDA.</li>

<p>Using relative valuation methods that requires the use of comparable firm is challenging in an alternative context due to differences in accounting methods, cultures, risk , and growth opportunities. Further, benchmarking is difficult because P/Es for individual firms in the same industry vary widely internationally and country market P/Es can vary significantly.</p>
<p>The usefulness of all price multiples is affected to some degree by differences in international accounting standards. The lease affected is P/adjusted CFO, P/FCFE, while P/B, P/E, P/EBITDA, and EV/EBITDA will be more seriously affected because they are more influenced by management’s choice of accounting methods and estimates.</p>

<p>The residual income valuation model breaks the intrinsic value of a stock into two elements: 1) current book value of equity and 2) present value of expected future residual income. <span class="math display">\[

\]</span> Values tends to be recognized earlier in the RI approach than in other present value-based approaches. To see this, recall that with a dividend discount model (DDM) or free cash flow to equity (FCFE) model, a large portion of the estimated intrinsic value comes from the present value of the expected terminal value. Yet the uncertainty of the expected terminal value is usually greater than any of the other forecasted cash flows because it occurs several years in the future. Valuation with residual income models, however, is relatively less sensitive to terminal value estimates, which reduces forecast error.</p>

<p>Two intangible asset require special attention: 1) goodwill and 2) R&amp;D expenditures.</p>
<p>To remove distortion, the amortization of intangibles capitalized during acquisition should be removed prior to computing the ROE used for residual income valuation.</p>
<p>The suggested analytical treatment of R&amp;D expenditures is less definitive, but we can make the general statement that the ROE estimate for a mature company should reflect the long-term productivity of the company’s R&amp;D expenditures: Productive R&amp;D expenditures increase ROE and residual income, and unproductive expenditure reduce ROE and residual income.</p>

<ul>
<li>Stage of lifecycle: Private companies are typically less mature than public firms.</li>
<li>Size: Private firms typically have less capital, fewer assets, and fewer employees than public firms and, as such, can be riskier. Accordingly, private firms are often valued using greater risk premiums and greater required returns compared to public firms.</li>
<li>Quality and depth of management: Smaller private firms may not be able to attract as many qualified applicants as public firms. This may reduce the depth of management, slow growth, and increase risk at private firm.</li>
<li>Management / shareholder overlap: In most private firms, management has a substantial ownership position. In this case, external shareholders have less influence and the firm may be able to take a longer-term perspective.</li>
<li>Short-term investors: Management of public firm may take a shorter-term view compared to private firms where managers are long-term holders of significant equity interests.</li>
<li>Quality of financial and other information: A potential creditor or equity investor in a private firm will have less information than is available for a public firm. This leads to greater uncertainty, higher risk, and reduces private firm valuations.</li>
<li>Taxes: Private firms may be more concerned with taxes than public firms.</li>

<li>Liquidity: Private company equity typically has fewer potential owners and is less liquid than publicly traded equity. Thus, a liquidity discount is often applied in valuing privately held shares.</li>
<li>Restrictions on marketability: Private companies often have agreements that prevent shareholders from selling, reducing the marketability of shares.</li>
<li>Concentration of control</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, company-specific factors can have positive or negative effects on private company valuations, whereas stock-specific factors are usually a negative.

</ol>
<p>Early in its life, a firm’s future cash flows may be subject to so much uncertainty that an asset-based approach would be most appropriate.

<p>Firm size is also a consideration in choosing a valuation methodology. Price multiples from large public firms should not be used to value a small private firm without some assurance that the risk and growth prospects of the firms are similar.</p>

<p>In valuing a firm, the appropriate earnings definition is normalized earnings: “firm earnings if the firm were acquired.”</p>
<section id="estimating-normalized-earnings" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimating-normalized-earnings">Estimating normalized earnings</h3>
<p>Normalized earnings should exclude nonrecurring and unusual items. In the case of private firms with a concentrated control, there may be discretionary or tax-motivated expenses that need to be adjusted when calculating normalized earnings.</p>
<p>Artificially low earnings may also be the result of excessively high owner compensation or of personal expenses charged to the firm. Use of company-owned assets potentially require an adjustment to earnings.</p>
<p>Any real estate owned by the firm may merit treatment separate from that of firm operations for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The real estate may have different risk characteristics than firm operations.</li>
<li>The real estate may have different growth prospects than firm operations.</li>
<li>Depreciation is most often based on historical cost and may understate the current cost in the market of the use of the assets.</li>
</ul>
<p>If it is used in the firm’s business, a market-estimated rental expense is used in calculating or estimating earnings. The value of real estate is therefore separated from its operations and treated as a nonoperating asset. If the real estate is leased from a related party, the lease rate should be adjusted to a market rate.</p>
<p>Other adjustments are common to both private and public companies. Additionally, some private firm financial statements are reviewed rather than audited; In any case, the analyst should be prepared to make further adjustments.</p>
</section>
<section id="strategic-and-nonstrategic-buyers" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="strategic-and-nonstrategic-buyers">Strategic and nonstrategic buyers</h3>
<p>In a strategic transaction, valuation of the firm is based in part on the perceived synergies with the acquirer’s other assets. A financial transaction assumes no synergies, as when one firm buys another in a dissimilar industry.</p>
</section>
<section id="estimating-cash-flow" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="estimating-cash-flow">Estimating cash flow</h3>
<p>Also, controlling and noncontrolling equity interests will have quite different values. These differences should be accounted for in cash flow estimates and assumptions.</p>
<p>When there is significant uncertainty about a private company’s future operations, the analyst should examine several scenarios when estimating future cash flows. For development stage firms, scenarios could include a sale of the firm, an IPO, bankruptcy, or continued private operation. For a mature firm, scenarios might include different ranges of cash flows based on different assumed growth rates.</p>
<p>The analyst should be aware of the potential bias in management estimates. For example, management may overstate the value of goodwill or understate future capital needs.</p>
<p>Although analysts use FCFF or FCFE depending on the purposes of the valuation, FCFF is usually more appropriate when the significant changes in the firm’s capital structure are anticipated. The reasoning is that the discount rate used for FCFF valuation, the weighted average cost of capital (WACC), is less sensitive to leverage changes than the cost of equity, the discount rate used for FCFE valuation.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="the-capitalized-cash-flow-method">The capitalized cash flow method</h3>
<p>Under this method, a single measure of economic benefit is divided by a capitalization rate to arrive at firm value, where the capitalization rate is the required rate of return minus a growth rate. This is a growing perpetuity model that assumes stable growth and is, in effect, a single-stage free cash flow model. It is most often used for small private companies. It may be suitable when no comparables are available, projections are quire uncertain, and stable growth is a reasonable assumption.</p>
<p>If growth is non-constant, the capitalized cash flow method (CCM) should be avoided in favor of the free cash flow method. <span class="math display">\[

<p>Excess earnings are firm earnings minus the earnings required to provide the required rate of return on working capital and fixed assets.

This value for the intangible assets is added to the values of working capital and fixed assets to arrive at firm value.</p>
<p>The excess earnings method (EEM) is used infrequently but can be used for small firms when their intangible assets are significant. However, the required return for working capital and fixed assets is subject to estimation error. <span class="math display">\[

<li>Size premiums: Size premiums are often added to the discount rates for small private companies.</li>
<li>Availability and cost of debt: A private firm may have less access to debt financing than a public firm. Because equity capital is usually more expensive than debt and because the higher operating risk of smaller private companies results in higher cost of debt as well. WACC will typically be higher for private firms.</li>
<li>Acquirer versus target: When acquiring a private firm, some acquirer will incorrectly use their own (lower) cost of capital, rather than the higher rate appropriate for the target, and arrive at a value of the target company that is too high.</li>
<li>Projection risk: Because of the lower availability of information from private firms and managers who are inexperienced at forecasting, that analysts should increase the discount rate used.</li>
<li>Lifecycle stage: It is particularly difficult to estimate the discount rate for firms in an early stage of development. If such firms have unusually high levels of unsystematic risk, the use of the CAPM may be inappropriate.</li>

<p>When evaluating a controlling equity interest in a private firm, the control premium should be estimated. Most public share trades are for small, noncontrolling interests; therefore, the price multiple does not reflect a control premium.</p>
<p>When estimating a control premium, the following issues should be considered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transaction type: strategic or financial (nonstrategic). A financial transactions typically has a smaller price premium.</li>
<li>Industry conditions: Periodically, there is a flurry in industry acquisition activity, diving up acquisition prices. In such markets, share prices of public companies may already reflect some premium for control, and adding a standard control premium to such share price may overstate the appropriate premium for control.</li>
<li>Type of consideration: Some historical acquisitions involves the acquirer’s stock rather than cash. Estimates of the control premium when acquisitions are made up shares that are at higher temporary or “bubble” values will be overstated.</li>
