<p>The relevant cash flows for evaluating a capital project are the incremental after-tax cash flows. How various real options give managers flexibility with capital budgeting projects. Even if you are unsure how to handle the calculation of NPV involving real options, remember that the existence of options will always increase NPV. Finally, familiarize yourself with alternative concepts of calculating income, including economic income, economic profit, residual income, and claims analysis, and pay attention to the proper discount rate under each method.</p>

<p>The capital budgeting process is the process of identifying and evaluating capital projects; that is, projects where the cash flow to the firm will be received over a period longer than a year. Any corporate decisions with an impact on future earnings can be examined using the framework. Decisions about whether to buy a new machine, expand business in another geographic area, move the corporate headquarters to Cleveland, or replace a delivery truck, to name a few, can be examined using a capital budgeting analysis.</p>

<li><p>Decisions are based on cash flows, not accounting income.</p>
<p>The relevant cash flows to consider as part of the capital budgeting process are incremental cash flows.</p>
<p>Sunk costs are costs that cannot be avoided, even if the project is not undertaken. (과거 cost는 고려하지 않음) An example of a sunk cost is a consulting fee paid to a marketing research firm to estimate demand for a new product prior to a decision on the project.</p>

<li><p>The timing of cash flows is important.</p>
<p>Capital budgeting decisions account for the time value of money, which means that cash flows received earlier are worth more than cash flows to be received later.</p></li>

<p>In general, a higher depreciation expense will result in greater tax savings and higher cash flows.

<li>Changes in inflation affect project profitability. - If inflation is higher than expected, future project cash flows are worth less, and the value of the project will be lower than expected.

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="capital-rationing">Capital rationing</h3>
<p>Capital rationing is the allocation of a fixed amount of capital among the set of available projects that will maximize shareholder wealth. Greatest total NPV.</p>
<p>Note that capital rationing is not the optimal decision from the firm’s perspective. Therefore, capital rationing violates market efficiency because society’s resources are not allocated to their best use (i.e., to generate the highest return).</p>
<p>Hard capital rationing occurs when the funds allocated to managers under the capital budget cannot be increased. Soft capital rationing occurs when managers are allowed to increase their allocated capital budget if they can justify to senior management that the additional funds will create shareholder value.</p>

<p>Sensitivity analysis involves changing an input (independent) variable to see how sensitive the dependent variable is to the input variable. For example, by varying sales, we could determine how sensitive a project’s NPV is to changes in sales, assuming that all other factors are held constant. The key to sensitivity analysis is to only change one variable at a time.</p>

<p>Scenario analysis is a risk analysis technique that considers both the sensitivity of some key output variable to changes in a key input variable and the likely probability distribution of these variables. The key difference between scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis is that scenario analysis allows for changes in multiple input variables all at once.</p>

<p>Using a project’s beta to determine discount rates is important when the risk of a project is different from the risk of the overall company. Simply using the company’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC) will overstate the required return for a conservative (low beta) project and will understate the required return for an aggressive (high beta) project.</p>

<p>The claims valuation approach (청구권 방식, FCFF, FCFE 활용) divides operating cash flows based on the claims of debt and equityholders that provide capital to the company. These debt and equity cash flows are valued separately and then added together to determine the value of the company.</p>
<p>The claims valuation method calculate the value of the company not the project. This is different from the economic profit and residual income approaches, which calculate both project and company value.</p>
<p>The claims valuation approach is based on the balance sheet concept that assets equal liabilities plus equity.</p>

<p>In moving to MM 1963, we are able to see how introducing taxes affects the cost of capital and firm value. Remember, the goal of managers in a capital structure decision is to minimize the weighted average cost of capital (and thereby maximize the value of the company).</p>

<p>In 1958, Professors Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller (MM) published their seminal work on capital structure theory. Under a very restrictive set of assumptions, MM proved that the value of a firm is unaffected by its capital structure. MM’s results suggest that in a perfect world, it does not matter how a firm finances its operations.</p>
<p>Assumptions</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital markets are perfectly competitive - There are no transaction costs, taxes, or bankruptcy costs.</li>
<li>Investors have homogeneous expectations</li>
<li>Riskless borrowing and lending - Investors can borrow/lend at the risk-free rate.</li>
<li>No agency costs - No conflict of interest between managers and shareholders.</li>
<li>Investment decisions are unaffected by financing decisions - Operating income is independent of how assets are financed.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the MM no-tax world, the value of a company is not affected by its capital structure.</p>

<p>Consider why the pie analogy holds true. The operating earnings (EBIT) of a firm are available to all providers of capital. In a company with no debt, all of the operating earnings are available to equityholders, and the value of the company is the discounted present value of these earnings. <span class="math display">\[
\\V_{L} = V_{U}

<p>MM’s second proposition with no taxes states that the cost of equity increases linearly as a company increases its proportion of debt financing. Therefore, the benefits of using a larger proposition of debt as a cheaper source of financing are offset by the rise in the cost of equity, resulting in no change in the firm’s weighted average cost of capital (WACC). <span class="math display">\[
\\r_{e} = r_{0} + \frac{D}{E}(r_{0} - r_{d})
\]</span> As leverage increases, the cost of equity increases, but WACC and the cost of debt are unchanged.</p>

<p>MM’s second proposition supports their first proposition. Because the benefits of lower cost debt are offset by the increased cost of equity, the relative amount of debt versus equity in the firm’s capital structure does not affect the overall value of the firm.</p>

<p>Tax shield provided by debt. Under the tax code of most countries, interest payments are a pretax expense and are therefore tax deductible, while dividends are paid on an after-tax basis.

<p>Costs of financial distress - static-trade-off theory (1973)</p>
<ul>
<li>Costs of financial distress and bankruptcy can be direct or indirect. Direct costs of financial distress include the cash expenses associated with the bankruptcy, such as legal fees and administrative fees. Indirect costs include foregone investment opportunities and the costs that result from losing the trust of customers, creditors, suppliers, and employees.</li>
<li>Probability of financial distress is related to the firm’s use of operating and financial leverage.</li>
</ul>
<p>Agency costs of equity refer to the costs associated with the conflicts of interest between managers and owners. Managers who do not have a stake in the company do not bear the costs associated with excessive compensation or taking on too much (or too little) risk.</p>
<p>Net agency cost of equity</p>
<ul>
<li>Monitoring costs</li>
<li>Bonding costs</li>
<li>Residual losses</li>
</ul>
<p>According to agency theory, the use of debt forces managers to be disciplined with regard to how they spend cash because they have less free cash to use for their own benefit.</p>
<p>Cost of asymmetric information refer to costs resulting from the fact that managers typically have more information about a company’s prospects and future performance that owners or creditors. Firms with complex products or little transparency in financial statements tend to have higher costs of asymmetric information, which results in higher required returns on debt and equity capital.</p>
<p>Because shareholders and creditors are aware that the asymmetric information problems exist, these investors will look for management behavior that ‘signals’ what knowledge management may have. Specifically, management’s choice of debt or equity financing may provide a signal regarding management’s opinion of the firm’s future prospects.</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking on the commitment to make fixed interest payments through debt financing sends a signal that management has confidence in the firm’s ability to make these payment in the future.</li>
<li>Issuing equity is typically viewed as a negative signal that managers believe a firm’s stock is overvalued.</li>
</ul>
<p>Pecking order theory, based on asymmetric information, is related to the signals management sends to investors through its financing choices. Financing choices under pecking order theory follow a hierarchy based on visibility to investors with internally generated capital being the most preferred, debt being the next best choice, and external equity being the least preferred financing option.</p>
<ul>
<li>Internally generated equity (RE)</li>
<li>Debt</li>
<li>External equity (newly issued shares)</li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, the pecking order theory predicts that the capital structure is a by-product of the individual financing decisions.</p>
</section>
<section id="static-trade-off-theory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="static-trade-off-theory">Static trade-off theory</h3>
<p>The static trade-off theory seeks to balance the costs of financial distress with the tax shield benefits from using debt. Under the static trade-off theory, there is an optimal capital structure that has an optimal proportion of debt.</p>
<p>If we remove the assumption that there are no costs of financial distress, there comes a point where the additional value added from the debt tax shield is exceeded by the value-reducing costs of financial distress from the additional borrowing. This point represents the optimal capital structure for a firm where the WACC is minimized and the value of the firm is maximized. <span class="math display">\[

<p>Dividend irrelevance. Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani (MM) maintain that dividend policy is irrelevant, as it has no effect on the price of a firm’s stock or its cost of capital. MM’s argument of dividend irrelevance is based on their concept of homemade dividends. Assume, for example, that you are a shareholder and you don’t like the firm’s dividend policy. If the firm’s cash dividend is too big, you can just take the excess cash received and use it to buy more of the firm’s stock. If the cash dividend you received was too small, you can sell a little bit of your stock in the firm to get the cash flow you want. In either case, the combination of the value of your investment in the firm and your cash in hand will be the same.</p>
<p>Bird-in-hand (dividend preference theory) argument for dividend policy.</p>
<p>Myron Gordon and John Lintner, however, argue that <span class="math inline">\(r_{s}\)</span> decreases as the dividend payout increases. Why? Because investors are less certain of receiving future capital gains from the reinvested earnings than they are of receiving current (and therefore certain) dividend payments.</p>
<p>Tax aversion. In many countries, dividends have historically been taxed at higher rates than capital gains. In the 1970s, US tax rates on dividend income were as high as 70%, while the taxes on capital gains were 35%.</p>
<p>In the real world, tax laws often prevent companies form accumulating excess earnings, making dividend payments necessary. Also note that in 2003, tax laws in the United States changed so that dividends and long-term capital gins are both taxed at the same 15% rate.</p>
<p>Conclusions from the three theories. The results of empirical tests are unclear as to which of these theories best explains the empirical observations of dividend policy.</p>

<p>Information asymmetry refers to differences in information available to a company’s board and management (insiders) as compared to the investors (outsiders).</p>
<p>The information conveyed by dividend initiation is ambiguous. On one hand, a dividend initiation could mean that a company is optimistic about the future and is sharing its wealth with stockholders-a positive signal. On the other hand, initiating a dividend could mean that a company has a lack of profitable reinvestment opportunities-a negative signal.</p>
<p>An unexpected dividend increase can signal to investors that a company’s future business prospects are strong and that managers will share the success with shareholders. Studies have found that companies with a long history of dividend increase, such as GE and Exxon Mobil, are dominant in their industries and have high returns on assets and low debt ratios.</p>
<p>Unexpected dividend decreases or omissions are typically negative signals that the business is in trouble and that management does not believe that the current dividend payment can be maintained.</p>

<p>Clientele effect. This refers to the varying dividend preferences of different groups of investors, such as individuals, institutions, and corporations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tax considerations - High-tax-bracket investors (like some individuals) tend to prefer low dividend payouts, while low-tax-bracket investors (like corporations and pension funds) may prefer high dividend payouts.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the stock goes ex-dividend: <span class="math display">\[

</ul>

<section id="agency-costs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="agency-costs">Agency costs</h3>
<p>Between shareholders and managers: Agency costs reflect the inefficiencies due to divergence of interests between managers and stockholders. One aspect of agency issue is that managers may have an incentive to overinvest (“empire building”). This may lead to investment in some negative NPV projects, which reduces stockholders wealth. One way to reduce agency cost is to increase the payout of free cash flow as dividends. Generally, it makes sense for growing firms to retain a larger proportion of their earnings.</p>
<p>Between shareholders and bondholders: When there is risky debt outstanding, shareholders can pay themselves a large dividend, leaving the bondholders with a lower asset base as collateral.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Investment opportunities - If a firm faces many profitable investment opportunities and has to react quickly to capitalize on the opportunities, the dividend payout may be low.</li>
<li>Expected volatility of future earnings - Hence, when earnings are volatile, firms are more cautious in changing dividend payout.</li>
<li>Financial flexibility - Firms with excess cash and a desire to maintain financial flexibility may resort to stock repurchases instead of dividends as a way to pay out excess cash. Since stock repurchase plans are not considered sticky (i.e., there is no implicit expectation by the market of an ongoing repurchase program), they don’t entail reduction in financial flexibility going forward.</li>
<li>Tax considerations - Investors are concerned about after-tax returns.</li>
<li>Floatation costs - When a company issues new shares of common stock, a floatation cost of 3% to 7% is taken from the amount of capital raised to pay for investment bankers and other costs associated with issuing the new stock. Since retained earnings have no such fee, the cost of new equity capital is always higher than the cost of retained earnings. Generally, the higher the floatation costs, the lower the dividend payout, given the need for equity capital in positive NPV projects.</li>
<li>Contractual and legal restrictions - Companies may be restricted from paying dividends either by legal requirements or by implicit restrictions caused by cash needs of the business.

<li>Impairment of capital rule</li>
<li>Debt covenants</li>

<p>Four common methods are used for share buybacks, though due to varying rules, some markets may not allow all methods. Outside the United States and Canada, method 1 is used almost exclusively.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Open market transactions are the most flexible approach, allowing a company to buy back its shares in the open market at the favorable terms.</li>
<li>Fixed price tender offer is an approach where the firm buys a predetermined number of shares at a fixed price, typically at a premium over the current market price. It allows a company to buy back its shares rather quickly. If more than the desired number of shares are tendered in response to the offer, the company will typically buy back a prorated number of shares from each shareholders responding to the offer.</li>
<li>Dutch auction is a tender offer in which the company specifies not a single fixed price but rather a range of prices. Dutch auctions identify the minimum clearing price for the desired number of shares that need to be repurchased. Each participating shareholder indicates the price and the number of shares tendered. Bids are accepted based on lowest price first until the desired quantity is filled.</li>
<li>Repurchase by direct negotiation entails purchasing shares from a major shareholder, often at a premium over market price. This method is often used in a greenmail scenario (where a hostile bidder is offered a premium to go away) to the detriment of the remaining shareholders.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="concentrated-ownership-vs.-dispersed-ownership">Concentrated ownership vs.&nbsp;Dispersed ownership</h3>
<p>Concentrated ownership, where a single shareholder or a group of shareholders have control over the corporation. These controlling shareholders can be a family, other companies, or a sovereign entity. Dispersed ownership refers to the situation where the shareholders are numerous and non has control.</p>
<p>Percentage ownership is not always a reliable indicator of concentration of control: certain shareholders may have a greater degree of control than their ownership percentage would suggest. A minority shareholder could have control of a corporation through a vertical ownership arrangement (where the group has a controlling interest in holding companies, which in turn have controlling interests in operating companies) or a horizontal ownership arrangement (where companies with common suppliers or customers cross-hold each other’s shares).</p>
<p>Another disconnect between control and percentage ownership comes in the form of dual-class shares, wherein one class of shareholders has fewer voting rights, while the other class has superior voting rights.</p>
</section>
<section id="conflicts-within-different-ownership-structures" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conflicts-within-different-ownership-structures">Conflicts within different ownership structures</h3>
<p>Dispersed ownership and dispersed voting power describes a situation where shareholders (called weak shareholders) do not hold power over managers (called strong managers). In this situation, principal-agent conflict is likely: shareholders want shareholder value maximized, while managers may use the firm’s resources to their own advantages. This problem can be mitigated by the presence of controlling shareholders.</p>
<p>Concentrated ownership and concentrated voting power refers to a situation where so-called ‘strong’ shareholders hold power over minority shareholders and ‘weak’ managers. This arrangement allows controlling shareholders to control the board of directors and effectively control and monitor management. The downside of this situation is that a principal-principal problem may arise: controlling owners can take advantage of firm resources to the detriment of minority owners.</p>
<p>Dispersed ownership and concentrated voting power indicates that the majority of the shares of a company are not owned by strong controlling shareholders. Rather, the controlling shareholders gain control over other minority shareholders through pyramid structures or dual-class shares, despite the controlling shareholders having less-than-majority ownership (again, the principal-principal problem). These controlling shareholders’ voting power also allows them to monitor management.</p>
<p>Concentrated ownership and dispersed voting power occurs in the presence of voting caps, where the voting rights of large share positions are restricted. Sovereign countries sometimes enact voting caps to discourage foreign investors from taking a controlling position in a company belonging to an industry that is considered important.</p>

<ol type="1">
<li>Banks - When a bank lends money to a firm or holds an equity stake, the bank can often exert some control over that corporation. (This is especially common in Asia and Europe.) The bank does not take advantage of its role as lender at the expense of other shareholders.</li>
<li>Families - In Latin America and some other places, family ownership is common. One advantage of family control is that principal-agent issues may be reduced. On the other hand, family ownership can make it difficult to recruit quality outsiders for management and often leads to lack of concern for minority shareholders, as well as minimal transparency and low accountability by management.</li>
<li>State-owned enterprises (SOE) - A listed SOE is partly owned by the government and also trades on an exchange.</li>
<li>Institutional investors - In many countries, institutional investors can represent a large portion of equity ownership.</li>
<li>Group companies - Such as South Korea’s Samsung, can achieve an outsized amount of control through cross-holding of shares via vertical and horizontal ownership.</li>
<li>Private equity firms - Introducing performance-based compensation for managers, or the addition of codes.</li>

<p>An acquisition refers to one company buying only part of another company. If the acquirer absorbs the entire target company, the transaction is considered a merger. The initiator of the venture is referred to as the bitter, or acquirer, while the opposite side of the transaction is known as the target.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="los-23.b-explain-common-motivations-behind-ma-activity.">LOS 23.b: Explain common motivations behind M&amp;A activity.</h2>
<p>Synergies - Cost synergies are exactly the strategy behind a pure horizontal merger. Revenue synergies are typically created by cross-selling products, increasing market share, or raising prices to take advantage of reduced competition.</p>
<p>Achieving more rapid growth - External growth via M&amp;A activity is usually a much faster way for managers to increase revenues than making investments internally (i.e., organic growth). Growth through M&amp;A is especially common in mature industries where organic growth opportunities are limited. In addition, it is typically a less risky way to generate growth by acquiring resources through a merger with another company rather than developing them internally.</p>
<p>Increased market power - When a horizontal merger occurs in an industry with few competitors, the newly combined company will typically come away with increased market share and a greater ability to influence market prices. Vertical mergers may also increase market power by reducing dependence on outside suppliers.</p>
<p>Gaining access to unique capabilities - If a company is lacking a specific capability or resource, it can either try to develop it internally or seek to acquire something that already exists. M&amp;A activity can be a cost effective way to acquire proven capabilities or resources.</p>
<p>Diversification - Managers may cite the need to diversify the firm’s cash flows as grounds for a merger. This makes no sense for shareholders but may be rational for the managers. It is much easier and cheaper for the shareholders to diversify simply by investing in the shares of unrelated companies themselves rather than having one company go through the long, expensive process of acquiring and merging the two firms’ operations and corporate cultures. In fact, research has revealed that conglomerates trade at a discount relative to the sum of the value of individual businesses. In this case, the whole is less than the sum of the individual parts. This finding demonstrates that mergers are not likely to increase value purely for diversification reasons.</p>
<p>Bootstrapping EPS - Another motivation for mergers is the bootstrapping effect on earnings per share that sometimes results from a stock deal.</p>
<p>Personal benefits for managers - This means that there is a strong financial incentive for managers to maximize the size of the firm rather than shareholder value. In addition, being part of the executive team for a larger company implies greater power and prestige and is probably good for managerial egos.</p>
<p>Tax benefits</p>
<p>Unlocking hidden value - When a company has struggled for an extended period of time, an acquirer may believe it can pay a lower price to buy the company and unlock hidden value by improving managements, adding resources, or improving the organizational structure.</p>
<p>Achieving international business goals</p>
<ul>
<li>Taking advantages of market inefficiencies - Acquiring a manufacturing plant in a country where labor costs are less expensive is a prime example of gaining an advantage from an inefficient global marketplace.</li>

<p>Bootstrapping is a way of packaging the combined earnings from two companies after a merger so that the merger generates an increase in the earnings per share of the acquirer, even when no real economic gains have been achieved.</p>
<p>The ‘Bootstrap effect’ occurs when a high P/E firm (generally a firm with high growth prospects) acquires a low P/E firm (generally a firm with low growth prospects) in a stock transaction. Post-merger, the earnings of the combined firm are simply the sum of the respective earnings prior to the merger. However, by purchasing the firm with a lower P/E, the acquiring firm is essentially exchanging higher-priced shares of lower-priced shares. As a result, the number of shares outstanding for the acquiring firm increases, but at a ratio that is less than 1-for-1. When we compute the EPS for the combined firm, the numerator (total earnings) is equal to the sum of the combined firms, but the denominator (total shares outstanding) is less than the sum of the combined firms. The result is higher reported EPS, even when the merger creates no additional synergistic value.</p>

</div>
<p>In practice, the market tends to recognize the bootstrapping effect and post-merger P/E’s adjust accordingly. However, there have been periods in history, such as the technology bubble in the late 1990s, where bootstrapping helped high P/E companies show EPS growth, even in cases where the mergers created no value for shareholders.</p>

<p>exchange ratio</p>

<section id="cash-offers" class="level4">
<h4 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="cash-offers">Cash offers</h4>
<p>When an acquirer is negotiating with a target over the method of payment, there are three main factors that should be considered:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Distribution between risk and reward for the acquirer and target shareholders. - In a stock offering, since the target company’s shareholders receive new shares in the post-merger company, they share in the risk related to the ultimate value that is realized from the merger. In a cash offering, all of the risk related to the value of the post-merger company is borne by the acquirer. As a result, when the acquirer is highly confident in the synergies and value that will be created by the merger, it is more inclined to push for a cash offering.</li>
<li>Relative valuations of companies involved. - If the acquirer’s shares are considered overvalued by the market, the acquirer is likely to want to use its overpriced shares as currency in the merger transaction. In fact, investors sometimes interpret a stock offering as a signal that the acquirer’s shares may be overvalued.</li>
<li>Changes in capital structure. - If the acquirer borrows money to raise cash for a cash offering, the associated debt will increase the acquirer’s financial leverage and risk. Issuing new stock for a securities offering can dilute the ownership interest for the acquirer’s existing shareholders.</li>

<p>Friendly merger offers usually begin with the acquirer directly approaching the target’s management. If both parties like the idea of a potential deal, they will negotiate the method of payment and the terms of the transaction. At this point, each party to the merger will conduct due diligence on the other party by examining financial statements and other records.</p>
<p>Hostile merger offers</p>
<ul>
<li>tender offer - the acquirer offers to buy the shares directly from the target shareholders, and each individual shareholder either accepts or rejects the offer.</li>
<li>proxy battle - the acquirer seeks to control the target by having shareholders approve a new ‘acquirer approved’ board of directors.</li>

<p>The first step in avoiding a hostile takeover offer is to simply say no.

The typical process is to attack the merger on anti-trust grounds or for some violation of securities law.

<p>A white knight is a friendly third party that comes to the rescue of the target company. The target will usually seek out a third party with a good strategic fit with the target that can justify a higher price than the hostile acquirer. In many cases, the white knight defense can start a bidding war between the hostile acquirer and the third party, resulting in the target receiving a very good price when a deal is ultimately completed. This tendency for the winner to overpay in a competitive bidding situation is called the winner’s curse.</p>

<p>Advantages</p>
<ul>
<li>Since the approach uses data from actual transactions, there is no need to estimate a separate takeover premium.</li>
<li>Estimates of value are derived directly from recent prices for actual deals completed in the marketplace rather than from assumptions and estimates about the future.</li>
<li>Use of prices established by recent transactions reduces the risk that the target’s shareholders could file a lawsuit against the target’s managers and board of directors for mispricing the deal.</li>
</ul>
<p>Disadvantages</p>
<ul>
<li>The approach implicitly assumes that the M&amp;A market valued past transactions accurately. If past transactions were over or underpriced, the mispricing will be carried over toe the estimated value for the target.</li>
<li>There may not be enough comparable transactions to develop a reliable data set for use in calculating the estimated target value.
