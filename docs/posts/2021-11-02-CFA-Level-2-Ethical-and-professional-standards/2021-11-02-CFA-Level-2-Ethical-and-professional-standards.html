<p>Trust is a foundation in the investment profession. Do not make anFy misrepresentations or give false impressions. This includes oral, electronic, and social media communications. Misrepresentations include guaranteeing investment performance and plagiarism. Plagiarism encompasses using someone else’s work (reports, forecasts, models, ideas, charts, graphs, and spreadsheet models) without giving them credit. Knowingly omitting information that could affect an investment decision or performance evaluation is considered misrepresentation.</p>
<p>Models and analysis developed by others at a member’s firm are the property of the firm and can be used without attribution. A report written by another analyst employed by the firm cannot be released as another analyst’s work.</p>

<p>Plagiarism is defined as copying or using in substantially the same form materials prepared by others without acknowledging the source of the material or identifying the author and publisher of such material. Members and candidates must not copy (or represent as their own) original ideas or material without permission and must acknowledge and identify the source of ideas or material that is not their own.</p>
<p>Misrepresentation through plagiarism in investment management can take various form. The simplest and most flagrant example is to take a research report or study done by another firm or person, change the names, and release the material as one’s own original analysis. This action is a clear violation of Standard I(C). Other practices include 1) using excerpts from articles or reports prepared by other either verbatim or with only slight changes in wording without acknowledgement, 2) citing specific quotations as attributable to “leading analysts” and “investment experts” without naming the specific references, 3) presenting statistical estimates of forecasts prepared by others and identifying the sources but without including the qualifying statements or caveats that may have been used, 4) using charts and graphs without stating their sources, and 5) copying proprietary computerized spreadsheets or algorithms without seeking the cooperation or authorization of their creators.</p>

<p>Information is “material” if its disclosure would impact the price of a security or if reasonable investors would want the information before making an investment decision. Ambiguous information, as far as its likely effect on price, may not be considered material. Information is “nonpublic” until it has been made available to the marketplace. an analyst conference call is not public disclosure. Selectively disclosing information by corporations creates the potential for insider-trading violations.</p>
<p>Some members and candidates may be involved in transactions during which they receive material nonpublic information provided by firms (e.g., investment banking transactions). Members and candidates may use the provided nonpublic information for its intended purpose, but must not use the information for any other purpose unless it becomes public information.</p>
