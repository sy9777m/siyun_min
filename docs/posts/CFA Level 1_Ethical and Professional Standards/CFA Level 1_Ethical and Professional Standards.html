<ul>
<li>Some of these misleading practices included:
<ul>
<li>Representative accounts - showing a top-performing portfolio as representative of a firm’s results.</li>
<li>Survivorship bias - excluding “weak performance” accounts that have been terminated.</li>
<li>Varying time periods - showing performance for selected time periods with outstanding returns.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>GIPS are a set of ethical principles based on a standardized, industry-wide approach.</li>
<li>Investment firms can voluntarily follow GIPS in their presentation of historical investment results to prospective clients.</li>
<li>These standards seek to avoid misrepresentations of performance.</li>
<li>GIPS apply to investment management firms and are intended to serve prospective and existing clients of investment firms.</li>
<li>GIPS allow clients to more easily compare investment performance among investment firms and have more confidence in reported performance.</li>
