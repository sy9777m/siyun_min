<li>The most common type of fixed-income security is a bond that promises to make a series of interest payments in fixed amounts and to repay the principal amount at maturity.</li>
<li>When market interest rates increase, the value of such bonds decrease because the present value of a bon’s promised cash flows decreases when a higher discount rate used.</li>
<li>Bonds are rated based on their relative probability of default (failure to make promised payments). Because investors prefer bonds with lower probability of default, bonds with lower credit quality must offer investors higher yields to compensate for the greater probability of default. Other things equal, a decrease in a bond’s rating (an increased probability of default) will decrease the price of the bond, thus increasing its yield.</li>

<li>When a bondholder sells a coupon bond prior to maturity, it may be at a gain or a loss relative to its purchase price. Such gains and losses are considered capital gains income (rather than ordinary taxable income).</li>
<li>Pure-discount bonds and other bonds sold at significant discount to par when issued are termed original issue discount (OID) bonds. Because the gains over an OID bond’s tenor as the price moves towards par value are really interest income, these bonds can generate a tax liability even when no cash interest payment has been made.</li>

<li>A call option has value to the issuer because it gives the issuer the right to redeem the bond and issue a new bond (borrow) if the market yield on the bond declines. This could occur either because interest rates in general have decreased or because the credit quality of the bond has increased (default risk has decreased).</li>

<li>주로 amortizing bond에 있음</li>
<li>Sinking fund provisions offer both advantages and disadvantages to bondholders.
<ul>
<li>On the plus side, bonds with a sinking fund provision have less credit risk because the periodic redemptions reduce the total amount of principal to be repaid at maturity. The presence of a sinking fund, however, can be a disadvantage to bondholders when interest rates fall.</li>
<li>This disadvantage to bondholders can be seen by considering the case where interest rates have fallen since bond issuance, so the bonds are trading at a price above the sinking funds redemption price.</li>
<li>This means the bonds have more reinvestment risk because bondholders who have their bonds redeemed can only reinvest the funds at the new, lower yield (assuming they buy bonds of similar risk).</li>

<li>A disadvantage of G-spreads and I-spreads is that they are theoretically correct only if the spot yield curve is flat so that yields are approximately the same across maturities. Normally, however, the spot yield curve is upward-sloping.</li>
<li>G-spreads랑 I-spreads는 YTM을 비교하는데, 이는 YTM = spot rate이어야 한다는 가정이 숨어있다.
<ul>
<li>기본적으로 YTM은 해당 만기의 coupon bond의 연 평균 수익률이 전 구간에 다 똑같이 적용되는데, spot rate는 이런 coupon bond를 기간별로 쪼개기 때문에 기간이 길면 길수록 spot rate가 높은 특성이 있다.</li>

<li>Z-spread는 국채 spot rate yield curve를 얼마나 들어올려야 회사채 spot rate yield curve가 되는지에 대한 수치이다.</li>

<ul>
<li>이 스프레드를 Z-spread라고 부르며, 이 spread에는 default risk, liquidity risk가 포함되어 있다.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Callable bond로 넘어오면, Z-spread에 call risk premium이 추가되면서 callable bond는 otherwise identical, 일반 straight bond보다 싸다.
<ul>
<li>그리고 이 callable bond price + call option value를 해서 계산하는데 사용된 spread를 Option-Adjusted Spread라고 한다.</li>
<li>이론적으로 이 계산법은 callable bond price에서 option의 가치를 제거해줬으므로 같은 조건의 straight bond의 Z-spread와 option-adjusted spread는 같아야 한다.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Straight bond z-spread &lt; callable bond z-spread</li>
<li>callable bond z-spread &gt; callable bond option-adjusted spread
<ul>
<li>이 둘의 차이가 call risk premium, call option value이다.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>An option-adjusted spread (OAS) is used for bonds with embedded options.</li>
<li>Loosely speaking, the option-adjusted spread takes the option yield component out of the Z-spread measure; the OAS is the spread to government spot rate curve that the bond would have if it were option-free.</li>
<li>If we calculate an OAS for a callable bond, it will be less than the bond’s Z-spread. The difference is the extra yield required to compensate bondholders for the call option. That exra yield is the option value.

<li>option value = Z-spread - OAS</li>

<ul>
<li>Securitization refers to a process by which financial assets are purchased by an entity that then issues securities supported by the cash flows from those financial assets.</li>
<li>The primary benefits of the securitization of financial assets are (1) a reduction in funding costs for firms selling the financial assets to the securitizing entity and (2) an increase in the liquidity of the underlying financial assets.</li>
<li>Compared to this traditional structure, with the bank serving the function of financial intermediary between borrowers and lenders, securitization can provide the following benefits:
<ul>
<li>Securitization reduces intermediation costs, which results in lower funding costs for borrowers and higher risk-adjusted returns for lenders (investors).</li>
<li>With securitization, the investors’ legal claim to the mortgages or other loans is stronger than it is with only a general claim against the bank’s overall assets.</li>
<li>When a bank securitizes its loans, the securities are actively traded, which increases the liquidity of the bank’s assets compared to holding the loans.</li>
<li>By securitizing loans, banks are able to lend more than if they could only fund loans with bank assets. When a loan portfolio is securitized, the bank receives the proceeds, which can then be used to make more loans.</li>
<li>Securitization has led to financial innovation that allows investors to invest in securities that better match their preferred risk, maturity, and return characteristics.</li>
<li>Securitization provides diversification and risk reduction compared to purchasing individual loans (whole loans).</li>
