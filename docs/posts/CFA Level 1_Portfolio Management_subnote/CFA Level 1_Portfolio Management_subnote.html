<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-describe-the-portfolio-approach-to-investing.">51.a. Describe the portfolio approach to investing.</h3>
<ul>
<li>A diversified portfolio produces reduced risk for a given level of expected return, compared to investing in an individual security. Modern portfolio theory concludes that investors that do not take a portfolio perspective bear risk that is not rewarded with greater expected return.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>The three steps in the portfolio management process are:
<ul>
<li>Planning:
<ul>
<li>Determine client needs and circumstances, including the client’s return objectives, risk tolerance, constraints, and preferences. Create, and then periodically review and update, an investment policy statement (IPS) that spells out these needs and circumstances.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Execution:
<ul>
<li>Construct the client portfolio by determining suitable allocations to various asset classes based on the IPS and on expectations about macroeconomic variables such as inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth (top-down analysis). Identify attractively priced securities within an asset class for client portfolios based on valuation estimates from security analysis (bottom-up analysis).</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Feedback:
<ul>
<li>monitor and rebalance the portfolio to adjust asset class allocations and securities holdings in response to market performance. Measure and report performance relative to the performance benchmark specified in the IPS.</li>

<ul>
<li>In a defined contribution plan, the employer contributes a certain sum each period to the employee’s retirement account. The employer makes no promise regarding the future value of the plan assets; thus, the employee assumes all of the investment risk.</li>
<li>In a defined benefit plan, the employer promises to make periodic payments to the employee after retirement. Because the employee’s future benefit is defined, the employer assumes the investment risk.</li>

<ul>
<li>The asset management industry comprises buy-side firms that manage investments for clients. Asset management firms include both independent managers and divisions of larger financial services companies and may be full-service or specialist firms offering investments in traditional or alternative asset classes.</li>
<li>Active management attempts to outperform a chosen benchmark through manager skill.</li>
<li>Passive management attempts to replicate the performance of a chosen benchmark index.</li>
<li>Most assets under management are actively managed, but the market share for passive management has been increasing.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="f.-describe-mutual-funds-and-compare-them-with-other-pooled-investment-products.">51.f. Describe mutual funds and compare them with other pooled investment products.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Mutual funds combine funds from many investors into a single portfolio that is invested in a specific class of securities or to match a specific index. Many varieties exist, including money market funds, bond funds, stock funds, and balanced (hybrid) funds. Open-ended shares can be bought or sold at the net asset value. Closed-ended funds have a fixed number of shares that trade at a price determined by the market.</li>
<li>Exchange-traded funds are similar to mutual funds, but investors can buy and sell ETF shares in the same way as shares in the same way as shares of stock. Management fees are generally low, though trading ETFs results in brokerage costs.</li>
<li>Separately managed accounts are portfolios managed for individual investors who have substantial assets. In return for an annual fee based on assets, the investor receives personalized investment advice.</li>
<li>Hedge funds are available only to accredited investors and are exempt from most reporting requirements. Many different hedge fund strategies exist. A typical annual fee structure is 20% of excess performance plus 2% of assets under management.</li>
<li>Buyout funds involve taking a company private by buying all available shares, usually funded by issuing debt. The company is then restructured to increase cash flow. Investors typically exit the investment within three to five years.</li>
<li>Venture capital funds are similar to buyout funds, except that the companies purchased are in the start-up phase. Venture capital funds, like buyout funds, also provide advice and expertise to the start-ups.</li>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="a.-calculate-and-interpret-major-return-measures-and-describe-their-appropriate-uses.">52.a. Calculate and interpret major return measures and describe their appropriate uses.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Holding period return is used to measure an investment’s return over a specific period.</li>
<li>Arithmetic mean return is the simple average of a series of periodic returns.</li>
<li>Geometric mean return is a compound annual rate.</li>
<li>Gross return is total return after deducting commissions on trades and other costs necessary to generate the returns, but before deducting fees for the management and administration of the investment account. Net return is the return after management and administration fees have been deducted.</li>
<li>Pretax nominal return is the numerical percentage return of an investment without considering the effects of taxes and inflation. After-tax nominal return is the numerical return after the tax liability is deducted, without adjusting for inflation. Real return is the increase in an investor’s purchasing power, roughly equal to nominal return minus inflation. Leveraged return is the gain or loss on an investment as a percentage of an investor’s cash investment.</li>

Compare the money-weighted and time-weighted rates of return and evaluate the performance of portfolios based on these measures.</h3>
<ul>
<li>The money-weighted rate of return is the IRR calculated using periodic cash flows into and out of an account and is the discount rate that makes the PV of cash inflows equal to the PV of cash outflows.</li>
<li>The time-weighted rate of return measures compound growth. It is the rate at which $1 compounds over a specified performance horizon.</li>
<li>If funds are added to a portfolio just before a periodic of poor performance, the money-weighted return will be lower than the time-weighted return. If funds are added just prior to a period of high returns, the money-weighted return will be higher than the time-weighted return.</li>
<li>The time-weighted return is the preferred measure of a manager’s ability to select investments. If the manager controls the money flows into and out of an account, the money-weighted return is the more appropriate performance measure.</li>

<ul>
<li>As predicted by theory, asset classes with the greatest average return have also had the highest risk.</li>
<li>Some of the major asset classes that investors consider when building a diversified portfolio include small-capitalization stocks, large-capitalization stocks, long-term corporate bonds, long-term Treasury bonds, and Treasury bills.</li>
<li>In addition to risk and return, when analyzing investments, investors also take into consideration an investment’s liquidity, as well as non-normal characteristics such as skewness and kurtosis.</li>

<ul>
<li>A risk-averse investor is one that dislikes risk. Given two investments that have equal expected returns, a risk-averse investor will choose the one with less risk. However, a risk-averse investor will hold risky assets if he feels that the extra return he expects to earn is adequate compensation for the additional risk. Assets in the financial markets are priced according to the preferences of risk-averse investors.</li>
<li>A risk-seeking (risk-loving) investor actually prefers more risk to less and, given investments with equal expected returns, will choose the more risky investment.</li>
<li>A risk-neutral investor has no preference regarding risk and would be indifferent between two investments with the same expected return but different standard deviation of returns.</li>

<ul>
<li>The greatest portfolio risk will result when the asset returns are perfectly positively correlated. As the correlation decreases from +1 to -1, portfolio risk decreases. The lower the correlation of asset returns, the greater the risk reduction (diversification) benefit of combining assets in a portfolio.</li>

Describe and interpret the minimum-variance and efficient frontiers of risky assets and the global minimum-variance portfolio.</h3>
<ul>
<li>For each level of expected portfolio return, the portfolio that has the least risk is known as a minimum-variance portfolio. Taken together, these portfolios form a line called the minimum-variance frontier.</li>
<li>On a risk versus return graph, the one risky portfolio that is farthest to the left (has the least risk) is known as the global minimum-variance portfolio.</li>
<li>Those portfolios that have the greatest expected return for each level of risk make up the efficient frontier. The efficient frontier coincides with the top portion of the minimum variance frontier. Risk-averse investors would only choose a portfolio that lies on the efficient frontier.</li>

Explain the selection of an optimal portfolio, given an investor’s utility (or risk aversion) and the capital allocation line.</h3>
<ul>
<li>An indifference curve plots combinations of risk and expected return that an investor finds equally acceptable. Indifference curves generally slope upward because risk-averse investors will only take on more risk if they are compensated with greater expected returns. a more risk-averse investor will have steeper indifference curves.</li>
<li>Flatter indifference curves (less risk aversion) result in an optimal portfolio with higher risk and higher expected return. An investor who is less risk averse will optimally choose a portfolio with more invested in the risky asset portfolio and less invested in the risk-free asset.</li>

<ul>
<li>The availability of a risk-free asset allows investors to build portfolios with superior risk-return properties. By combining a risk-free asset with a portfolio of risky assets, the overall risk and return can be adjusted to appeal to investors with various degrees of risk aversion.</li>

<ul>
<li>On a graph of return versus risk, the various combinations of a risky asset and the risk-free asset form the capital allocation line (CAL).

Explain systematic and nonsystematic risk, including why an investor should not expect to receive additional return for bearing nonsystematic risk.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Systematic (market) risk is due to factors, such as GDP growth and interest rate changes, that affect the values of all risky securities. systematic risk cannot be reduced by diversification.</li>
<li>Unsystematic (firm-specific) risk can be reduced by portfolio diversification.</li>
<li>Because one of the assumptions underlying the CAPM&lt; is that portfolio diversification to eliminate unsystematic risk is costless, investors cannot increase expected equilibrium portfolio returns by taking on unsystematic risk.</li>

<ul>
<li>A return generating model is an equation that estimates the expected return of an investment, based on a security’s exposure to one or more macroeconomic, fundamental, or statistical factors.</li>
<li>The simplest return generating model is the market model, which assumes the return on an asset is related to the return on the market portfolio in the following manner:</li>

<li>The CAPM and the SML indicate what a security’s equilibrium required rated of return should be based on the security’s exposure to market risk. An analyst can compare his expected rate of return on a security to the required rate of return indicated by the SML to determine whether the security is overvalued, undervalued, or properly valued.</li>

<ul>
<li>Introduction-Describes the client.</li>
<li>Statement of Purpose-The intentions of the IPS</li>
<li>Statement of Duties and Responsibilities-Of the client, the asset custodian, and the investment managers.</li>

<ul>
<li>Willingness to take financial risk is related to an investor’s psychological factors, such as personality type and level of financial knowledge.</li>
<li>Ability or capacity to take risk depends on financial factors, such as wealth relative to liabilities, income stability, and time horizon.</li>
<li>A client’s overall risk tolerance depends on both his ability to take risk and his willingness to take risk. A willingness greater than ability, or vice versa, is typically resolved by choosing the more conservative of the two and counseling the client.</li>

<li>Time horizon-Often the period over which assets are accumulated and before withdrawals begin. Risky or illiquid investments may be inappropriate for an investor with a short time horizon.</li>
<li>Tax considerations-Concerns the tax treatments of the investor’s various accounts, the relative tax treatment of capital gains and income, and the investor’s marginal tax bracket.</li>
<li>Legal and regulatory-Constraints such as government restrictions on portfolio contents or laws against insider trading.</li>

<ul>
<li>Imposing portfolio constraints based on ESG factors may affect performance. Limiting the universe of investment choices may decrease returns, but good corporate governance and low ESG-related risks may increase returns.</li>
<li>If a portfolio’s investment universe is constrained by negative screening, its performance should be measured against a bench mark that excluded companies with negative ESG factors.</li>
<li>Positive screening, best-in-class, or thematic investing approaches typically require portfolio construction to be customized for the investor’s choices of which ESG factors to focus on.</li>
<li>For active ownership, it is important to clarify whether investors intend to vote their shares themselves or direct managers to vote the shares according to specified ESG factors.</li>

<ul>
<li>Risk of assets is measured by standard deviation, beta, or duration. Derivatives risk measures include delta, gamma, vega, and rho. Tail risk is measured with value at risk (VaR) or Conditional VaR. Some risks must be measured subjectively.</li>
<li>An organization may decide to bear a risk (self-insurance), avoid or take steps to prevent a risk, efficiently manage a risk through diversification, transfer a risk with insurance or a surety bond, or shift a risk (change the distribution of uncertain outcomes) with derivatives.</li>
<li>Organizations may use multiple methods of risk modification after considering the costs and benefits of the various methods. The end result is a risk profile that matches the organization’s risk tolerance and includes the risks that top management has determined match the organization’s goals.</li>
