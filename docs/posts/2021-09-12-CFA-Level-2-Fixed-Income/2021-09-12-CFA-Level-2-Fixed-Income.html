<p>Spot rates are the annualized market interest rates for a single payment to be received in the future. Generally, we use spot rates for government securities (risk-free) to generate the spot rate curve.</p>
<p>The spot interest rate is the yield to maturity of a zero-coupon bond.</p>
<p>The term structure of spot rates is known as the spot curve. The shape and level of the spot curve changes continuously with the market prices of bonds.</p>

<p>Expected return is the ex-ante holding period return that a bond investor expects to earn. The expected return will be equal to the bond’s yield only when all three of the following are true:</p>
<p>- The bond is held to maturity</p>
<p>- All payments (coupon and principal) are made on time and in full</p>
<p>o option-free, no default risk, no prepayment risk</p>
<p>- All coupons are reinvested at the original YTM</p>
<p>o If the yield curve is not flat, the coupon payments will not be reinvested at the YTM and the expected return will differ from the yield.</p>

<p>A par rate is the yield to maturity of a bond trading at par. Generally, par curve refers to the par rates for government or benchmark bonds.</p>
<p>By using a process called bootstrapping, spot rates or zero-coupon rates can be derived from the par curve.</p>

<p>For an upward-sloping spot curve the forward rate rises as increases. For downward-sloping spot curve, the forward rate declines as increases. For an upward-sloping spot curve, the forward curve will be above the spot curve. Conversely, when the spot curve is downward sloping, the forward curve will be below it.</p>

<p>Forward rate는 현재 상황에서 관찰된 미래 시점의 단위기간 금리일 뿐, 시간이 지나면 변화한다. 그러므로 forward contract들도 expiration이 되면 해당 시점의 contract value와 forward price가 다를 수 있다. 만기 시점의 contract value = forward price이려면, 계약 시점에 관찰된 forward rate가 미래인 만기 시점에 spot rate로 정확히 실현되어야 한다.</p>
<p>If the future spot rates actually evolve as forecasted by the forward curve, the forward price will remain unchanged. Therefore, a change in the forward price indicates that the future spot rate(s) did not conform to the forward curve. When spot rates turn out to be lower (higher) than implied by the forward curve, the forward price will increase (decrease). A trader expecting lower future spot rates (then implied by the current forward rates) would purchase the forward contract to profit from its appreciation.</p>
<p>For a bond investor, the return on a bond over a one-year horizon is always equal to the one-year risk-free rate if the future spot rates evolve as predicted by today’s forward curve. If the spot curve one year from today is not the same as that predicted by today’s forward curve, the return over the one-year period will differ, with the return depending on the bond’s maturity.</p>
<p>An active portfolio manager will try to outperform the overall bond market by predicting how the future spot rates will differ from those predicted by the current forward curve.</p>
<p>If an investor believes that future spot rates will be lower than corresponding forward rates, then she will purchase bonds (at a presumably attractive price) because the market appears to be discounting future cash flows at “too high” of a discount rate.</p>

<p>With an upward-sloping interest rate term structure, investors seeking superior returns may pursue a strategy called riding the yield curve (also known as rolling down the yield curve). Under this strategy, an investor will purchase bonds with maturities longer than his investment horizon. In an upward-sloping yield curve, shorter maturity bonds have lower yields than longer maturity bonds. As the bond approaches maturity, it is valued using successively lower yields and, therefore, at successively higher prices.</p>
<p>If the yield curve remains unchanged over the investment horizon, riding the yield curve strategy will produce higher returns than a simple maturity matching strategy, increasing the total return of a bond portfolio. The greater the difference between the forward rate and the spot rate, and the longer the maturity of the bond, the higher the total return. (shoulder effect)</p>

<p>The Z-spread is the spread that, when added to each spot rate on the default-free spot curve, makes the present value of a bond’s cash flows equal to the risky bond’s market price. Therefore, the Z-spread is a spread over the entire spot rate curve.</p>

<p>The TED in TED spread is an acronym that combines the T in T-bill with ED, the ticker symbol for the Eurodollar futures contract.</p>
<p>TED spread = 3-month LIBOR rate – 3-month T-bill rate</p>
<p>Because T-bill are considered to risk free while LIBOR reflects the risk of lending to commercial banks, the TED spread is seen as an indication of the risk of interbank loans. A rising TED spread indicates that market participants believe banks are increasingly likely to default on loans and that risk-free T-bill are becoming more valuable in comparison.

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="unbiased-expectation-theory">Unbiased expectation theory</h2>
<p>Pure expectation theory</p>
<p>We hypothesize that it is investors’ expectations that determine the shape of the interest rate term structure.</p>
<p>Specifically, this theory suggests that forward rates are solely a function of expected future spot rates, and the every maturity strategy has the same expectation return over a given investment horizon. In other words, long-term interest rates equal the mean of future expected short-term rates. This implies that an investor should earn the same return by investing in a five-year bond or by investing in a three-year bond and then a two-year bond after the three-year bond matures. Similarly, an investor with a three-year investment horizon would be indifferent between investing in a three-year bond or in a five-year bond that will be sold two years prior to maturity. The underlying principle behind the pure expectations theory is risk neutrality.</p>
<p>The implications for the shape of the yield curve under the pure expectations theory are:</p>
<p>- if the yield curve is upward sloping, short-term rates are expected to rise.</p>
<p>- if the curve is downward sloping, short-term rates are expected to fall.</p>

<p>The liquidity preference theory of the term structure addresses the shortcomings of the pure expectations theory by proposing that forward rates reflects investors’ expectations of future spot rates, plus a liquidity premium to compensate investors for exposure to interest rate risk. The theory suggests that this liquidity premium is positively related to maturity.</p>
<p>The liquidity preference theory states that forward rates are upward-biased estimates of the market’s expectation of future rates because they include a liquidity premium. Therefore, a positive-sloping yield curve may indicate that either: (1) the market expects future interest rates to rise or (2) rates are expected to remain constant (or even fall), but the addition of the liquidity premium results in a positive slope.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="path-dependency">Path dependency</h2>
<p>Unlike call risk, prepayment risk is affected not only by the level of interest rate at a particular point in time, but also by the path rates took to get there.</p>
<p>An important assumption of the binomial valuation process is that the value of the cash flows at a given point in time is independent of the path that interest rates followed up to that point. In other words, cash flows are not path dependent; cash flows at any node do not depend on the path rates took to get to that node. Because of path dependency of cash flows of mortgage-backed securities, the binomial tree backward induction process cannot be used to value such securities. We instead use the Monte Carlo simulation method to value mortgage-backed securities.</p>
<p>A monte Carlo forward-rate simulation involves randomly generating a large number of interest rate paths, using a model that incorporates a volatility assumption and assumed probability distribution. A key feature of the Monte Carlo method is that the underlying cash flows can be path dependent.</p>
<p>As with pathwise valuation, the value of the bond is the average of values from the various paths. The simulated paths should be calibrated so benchmark interest rate paths value benchmark securities at their market price (i.e.&nbsp;arbitrage-free valuation). The calibration process entails adding (subtracting) a constant to all rates when the value obtained from the simulated paths is too high (too low) relative to market prices. This calibration process results in a drift adjusted model.</p>
<p>A Monte Carlo simulation may impose upper and lower bounds on interest rates as part of the model generating the simulated paths. These bounds are based on the notion of mean reversion; rates tend to rise when they are too low and fall when they are too high.</p>

<h1>LOS 34.h: Explain how interest rate volatility affects option-adjusted spreads.</h1>
<p>The OAS calculated varied depending on the volatility assumption used. When we use a higher estimate of volatility to value a callable bond, the calculated value of the call option increases, the calculated value of the straight bond is unaffected, and the computed value (not the market price) of the callable bond decreases (since the bondholder is short the option). Hence when the estimated (or assumed) volatility (of benchmark rates) used in a binomial tree is higher, the computed value of a callable bond will be lower-and therefore closer to its true market price. The constant spread that needs to be added to the benchmark rates to correctly price the bond (the OAS) is therefore lower.</p>
<p>As the assumed level of volatility used in an interest rate tree increases, the computed OAS (for a given market price) for a callable bond decreases. Similarly, the computed OAS of a putable bond increases as the assumed level of volatility in the binomial tree increases.</p>

<h1>LOS 34.j: Compare effective durations of callable, putable, and straight bonds.</h1>
<p>Both call and put options have the potential to reduce the life of a bond, so the duration of callable and putable bonds will be less than or equal to the duration of their straight counterparts.</p>
<p>- Effective duration (callable, putable) &lt;= effective duration (straight)</p>

<section id="one-sided-durations" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="one-sided-durations">One-sided durations</h2>
<p>For bonds with embedded options, one-sided durations-durations that apply only when interest rates rise (or, alternatively, only when rates fall)-are better at capturing interest rate sensitivity than simple effective duration. When the underlying option is at-the-money (or near-the-money), callable bonds will have lower one-sided down-duration than one-sided up-duration: the price change of a callable when rates fall is smaller than the price change for an equal increase in rates. Conversely, a near-the-money putable bond will have larger one-sided down-duration than one-sided up-duration.</p>
</section>
<section id="key-rate-duration-1" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="key-rate-duration-1">Key rate duration</h2>
<p>Key rate duration or partial durations capture the interest rate sensitivity of a bond to changes in yields (par rates) of specific benchmark maturities. Key rate duration is used to identify the interest rate risk from changes in the shape of the yield curve (shaping risk).</p>
<section id="generalization" class="level3">

<p>\1. If an option-free bond is trading at par, the bond’s maturity-matched rate is the only rate that affects the bond’s value. Its maturity key rate duration is the same as its effective duration, and all other rate durations are zero.</p>
<p>\2. For an option-free bond not trading at par, the maturity-matched rate is still the most important rate.</p>
<p>\3. A bond with low (or zero) coupon rate may have negative key rate durations for horizons other than the bond’s maturity.</p>
<p>\4. A callable bond with a low coupon rate is unlikely to be called; hence, the bond’s maturity-matched rate is the most critical rate.</p>
<p>\5. All else equal, higher coupon bonds are more likely to be called, and therefore the time-to-exercise rate will tend to dominate the time-to-maturity rate.</p>
<p>\6. Putable bonds with high coupon rates are unlikely to be put, and thus are most sensitive to their maturity-matched rates.</p>
<p>\7. All else equal, lower coupon bonds are more likely to be put, and therefore the time-to-exercise rate will tend to dominate the time-to-maturity rate.</p>

<h1><img src="./clip_image112.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Diagram Description automatically generated"> LOS 34.n: Describe defining features of a convertible bond.</h1>
<p>The owner of a convertible bond has the right to convert the bond into a fixed number of common shares of the issuer during a specified timeframe (conversion period) and at a fixed amount of money (conversion price). Convertibles allow investors to enjoy the upside on the issuer’s stock, although this comes at a cost of lower yield. The issuer of a convertible bond benefits from a lower borrowing cost, but existing shareholders may face dilution if the conversion option is exercised.</p>
<p>The conversion ratio is the number of common shares for which a convertible bond can be exchanged. Initial conversion ratio of 10 allows its holder to convert one $1000 par bond into 10 shares of common stock.</p>
<p>Conversion value = stock-equivalent value</p>
<p>Minimum value of CB = Max(conversion value, straight value)</p>
<p>Market conversion price = BEP stock price</p>
<p>The conversion price of the bond is $1000 / 10 shares = $100.</p>
<p>Offer documents may also provide a contingent put option in the event of any change-of-control events such as mergers. Alternatively, lower conversion price may be specified in the event of a change of control. The conversion ratio may also be adjusted upward if the company pays a dividend in excess of a specified threshold dividend.</p>

<p>The following comparisons can be made between ownership of the underlying stock and the risk-return characteristics of the convertible bond:</p>
<p>- When the stock’s price falls, the returns on convertible bonds exceed those of the stock, because the convertible bond’s price has a floor equal to its straight bond value.</p>
<p>- When the stock’s price rises, the bond will underperform because of the conversion premium. This is the main drawback of investing in convertible bonds versus investing directly in the stock.</p>
<p>- If the stock’s price remains stable, the return on a convertible bond may exceed the stock return due to the coupon payments received from the bond, assuming no change in interest rates or credit risk of the issuer.</p>
<p>Sometimes the price of the common stock associated with a convertible issue is so low that is has little or no effect on the convertible’s market price, and the bond trades as though it is a straight bond. When this happens, the convertible security is referred to as a fixed-income equivalent or a busted convertible.</p>

<h1>LOS 36.a: Describe credit default swap (CDS), single-name and index CDS, and the parameters that define a given CDS product.</h1>
<p>A credit default swap (CDS) is essentially an insurance contract.</p>
<p>Protection buyer = long credit risk = short credit</p>
<p>Protection seller = short credit risk = long credit</p>
<p>To obtain this coverage, the protection buyer pays the seller a premium called the CDS premium to the protection seller. The contract is written on a face value of protection called the notional principal.</p>
<p>Even though the CDS spread should be based on the underlying credit risk of the reference obligation, standardization in the market has led to a fixed coupon on CDS product: 1% for investment-grade securities and 5% for high-yield securities. Hence, the coupon rate on the CDS and the actual credit spread may be different. The present value of the difference between the standardization coupon rate and the credit spread on the reference obligation is paid upgront by one of the parties to the contract.</p>
<p>For a protection buyer, a CDS has some of the characteristics of a put option-when the underlying performs poorly, the holder of the put option has a right to exercise the option.</p>
<p>The International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA), the unofficial governing body of the industry, publishes standardized contract terms and conventions in the ISDA Master Agreement to facilitate smooth functioning of the CDS market.</p>

<h1>LOS 36.c: Explain the principles underlying, and factors that influence, the market’s pricing of CDS.</h1>
<p>The factors that influence the pricing of CDS include the 1) probability of default, 2) loss given default. The CDS spread is higher for higher probability of default and for higher loss given default.</p>
<p>Probability of default is the likelihood of default by the reference entity in a given year. However, because the CDS typically covers a multi-year horizon, the probability of default is not constant; the probability of default usually increases over time. For a single-name CDS, when a default occurs, a payment is made by the protection seller to the protection buyer and the CDS ceases to exist. Hence, in the context of a CDS, the probability of default in any given year assumes that no default has occurred in the preceding years. We call the probability of default given that it has not already occurred the conditional probability of default or hazard rate.</p>
<p>Loss given default is the expected amount of loss in the event that a default occurs.</p>
<p>Expected loss at t = hazard rate at t * loss given default</p>
<p>Loss given default (%) = 1 – recovery rate</p>

<p>The cash payments made by the protection buyer on the CDS cease when there is a default. Hence, the expected value of the coupon payments also depends on the hazard rate.</p>
<p>The payments made by the protection buyer to the seller are the premium leg. These contingent payments make up the protection leg.</p>
<p>The difference between the present value of the premium leg and the present value of the protection leg determines the upfront payment.</p>
<p>Upfront payment (by protection buyer) = PV(protection leg) – PV(premium leg)</p>
<p>We can appropriate the upfront premium as the difference between the CDS spread and the CDS coupon rate, multiplied by the duration of the CDS.</p>
<p>Upfront premium % = (CDS spread – CDS coupon) * duration</p>
<p>CDS spread = upfront premium % / duration + CDS coupon</p>
<p>Price of CDS (per $100 notional) = $100 – upfront premium (%)</p>
<section id="valuation-after-inception-of-cds" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="valuation-after-inception-of-cds">Valuation after inception of CDS</h2>
<p>At inception of a CDS, the CDS spread (and the upfront premium) is computed based on the credit quality of the reference entity. After inception, the credit quality of the reference entity (or the credit risk premium in the overall market) may change. This will lead to the underlying CDS having a nonzero value.</p>
<p>The change in value of a CDS after inception can be approximated by the change in spread multiplied by the duration of the CDS.</p>
<p>Profit for protection buyer = change in spread * duration * notional principal</p>
<p>Profit for protection buyer (%) = change in spread (%) * duration</p>
<p>The protection buyer (or seller) can unwind an existing CDS exposure (prior to expiration or default) by entering into an offsetting transaction. This process of capturing value from an in-the-money CDS exposure is called monetizing the gain.</p>

<h1>LOS 35.a: Explain expected exposure, the loss given default, the probability of default, and the credit valuation adjustment.</h1>
<p>Expected exposure is the amount of money a bond investor in a credit risky bond stands to lose at a point in time before any recovery is factored in. A bond’s expected exposure changes over time.</p>
<p>Recovery rate is the percentage recovered in the event of a default.</p>
<p>Loss given default (LGD) is equal to loss severity multiplied by exposure.</p>
<p>Probability of default is the likelihood of default occurring a given year. The initial probability of default is also known as the hazard rate. The probability of default in each subsequent year is calculated as the conditional probability of default given that default has previously not occurred.</p>
<p>Probability of survival at t = (1 – hazard rate)^t if hazard rate is constant</p>
<p>Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is the sum of the present value of the expected loss for each period. CVA is the monetary value of the credit risk in present value terms; it is the difference in value between a risk-free bond and an otherwise identical risky bond.</p>
<p>CVA = price of risk-free bond – price of risky bond</p>

<p>Risk neutral probability of default, which is the probability of default implied in the current market price.</p>
<p>We can also calculate the implied recovery rate in the market price given the probability of default. In general, given the market price (and hence the credit spread), the estimated risk neutral probabilities of default and recovery rates are positively correlated.</p>

<h1>LOS 35.b: Explain credit scores and credit ratings.</h1>
<p>Credit scoring is used for small businesses and individuals. A higher credit score indicates better credit quality.</p>
<p>Credit ratings are issued for corporate debt, asset-backed securities, and government and quasi-government debt. The issuer rating for a company is typically for its senior unsecured debt. Ratings on other classes of debt by the same issuer may be notched. Notching is the practice of lowering the rating by one or more levels for more subordinated debt of the issuer. Notching accounts for LGD difference between classes of debt by the same issuer (higher LGD for issues with lower seniority).</p>

<section id="structural-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="structural-models">Structural models</h2>
<p>Structural models of corporate credit risk are based on the structure of a company’s balance sheet and rely on insights provided by option pricing theory.</p>
<section id="option-analogy" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="option-analogy">Option analogy</h3>
<p>Consider a hypothetical company with assets that are financed by equity and a single issue of zero-coupon debt.</p>
<p>Due to the limited liability nature of corporate equity, the shareholders effectively have a call option on the company’s assets with a strike price equal to the face value of debt.</p>
<p>An alternate, but related interpretation considers equity investors as long the net assets of the company and long a put option, allowing them to seel the assets at an exercise price of X. default is then synonymous to exercising the put opition.</p>
<p>Under the put option analogy, the investors in risky debt can be constructed to have a long position in risk-free debt and a short position in that put option.</p>
<p>Value of risky debt = value of risk-free debt – value of put option</p>
<p>Value of risky debt = value of risk-free debt – CVA</p>
<p>The value of the put option = CVA</p>
<p>If the value of assets falls below the default barrier X, the company defaults. The probability of default is indicated by the region in the left tail below the default barrier of X.</p>
<p>Advantages of structural models</p>
<p>- Structural models provide an economic rationale for default and explain why default occurs.</p>
<p>- Structural models utilize option pricing models to value risky debt.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of structural models</p>
<p>- Because structural models assume a simple balance sheet structure, complex balance sheets cannot be modeled. Additionally, when companies have off-balance sheet debt, the default barrier under structural models (X) would be inaccurate and hence the estimate outputs of the model will be inaccurate.</p>
<p>- One of the key assumptions of the structural model is that the assets of the company are traded in the market. This restrictive assumption makes the structural model impractical.</p>

<section id="reduced-form-models" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="reduced-form-models">Reduced form models</h2>
<p>Reduced form (RF) models do not rely on the structure of a company’s balance sheet and therefore do not assume that the assets of the company trade. Unlike the structural model, reduce form models do not explain why default occurs. Instead, they statistically model when default occurs. Default under the RF model is a randomly occurring exogenous variable.</p>
<p>A key input into the RF model is the default intensity, which is the probability of default over the next (small) time period. Default intensity can be estimated using regression models.</p>
<p>Advantages of reduced form models</p>
<p>- RF models do not assume that the assets of a company trade</p>
<p>- Default intensity is allowed to vary as company fundamentals changes, as well as when the state of the economy changes.</p>
<p>Disadvantages of reduced form models</p>
<p>- RF models do not explain why default occurs.</p>
<p>- Under RF models, default is treated as a random event, but in reality, default is rarely a surprise.</p>

<h1>Los 35.e: Calculate the value of a bond and its credit spread, given assumptions about the credit risk parameters.</h1>
<p>Credit spread on a risky bond = YTM of risky bond – YTM of benchmark</p>

<p>We use our standard backward induction process to value a risky bond given the benchmark rate tree.</p>

<section id="los-35.f-interpret-changes-in-a-credit-spread." class="level1">
<h1>LOS 35.f: Interpret changes in a credit spread.</h1>
<p>A benchmark yield should be equal to the real risk-free rate plus expected inflation as well as a risk-premium for uncertainty in future inflation. Credit spreads include compensation for default, liquidity, and taxation risks relative to the benchmark. Adjustment to the price for all these risk factors together is known as the XVA. Default risk component is the most important and most-commonly-used in practice.</p>
<p>Credit spreads change as investor perceptions about the future probability of default and recovery rates change. These perceptions depend on expectations about the state of the economy. Expectations of impending recessions lead to expectations of higher defaults and lower recovery rates.</p>

<h1>LOS 35.g: Explain the determinants of the term structure of credit spreads and interpret a term structure of credit spreads.</h1>
<p>The term structure of credit spread shows the relationship between credit spreads and maturity.</p>
<p>The credit spread is inversely related to the recovery rate and positively related to the probability of default. However, oftentimes a maturity-matched, liquid benchmark security is not available. In such cases, interpolation from available benchmark securities is used. When such data is not easily available, or when benchmark bonds are thinly traded, a spread relative to a swap fixed rate (corresponding to the maturity of the bond) may be used.</p>
<p>To create a spread curve, all of the bonds whose spreads are used should have similar credit characteristics.</p>
<p>Key determinants of the shape of the credit spread curve include expectations about future recovery rates and default probabilities. If default probabilities are expected to be higher or recovery rates lower in the future, the credit curve would be expected to be positively sloped. Flat credit curves indicates stable expectations over time.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="determinants-of-term-structure-of-credit-spreads">Determinants of term structure of credit spreads</h2>
<p>\1. Credit quality – lower-rated sectors tend to have steeper spread curves, reflecting greater uncertainty as well as greater sensitivity to the business cycle.</p>
<p>\2. Financial conditions – spreads narrow during economic expansions and widen during cyclical downturns. During boom times, benchmark yields tend to be higher while credit spreads tend to be narrower.</p>
<p>\3. Market demand and supply – recall that a credit spread includes a premium for lack of liquidity. Hence, less liquid maturities would show higher spreads (even if the expectations for that time period are stable). Due to low liquidity in most corporate issues, the credit curves are most heavily influenced by more heavily traded bonds.</p>
<p>\4. Equity market volatility – increases in equity volatility therefore tend to widen spreads and influence the shape of the credit spread curve.</p>

<p>Credit analysis of structured, securitized debt begins with the collateral pool. Homogeneity of a pool refers to the similarity of the assets within the collateral pool. Granularity refers to the transparency of assets within the pool. A highly granular pool would have hundreds of clearly defined loans, allowing for use of summary statistics as opposed to investigating each borrower.</p>
<p>Short-term granular and homogeneous structured finance vehicles are evaluated using a statistical-based approach. Medium-term granular and homogeneous obligations are evaluated using a portfolio-based approach because the portfolio composition varies over time. (segmentation해서 analysis) discrete and non-granular portfolios have to be evaluated at the individual loan level.</p>
