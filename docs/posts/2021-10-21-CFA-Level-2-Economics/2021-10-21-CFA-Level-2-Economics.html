<p>a quote of 1.4126 USD/EUR means that each euro costs $1.4126. The euro is called the base currency and the USD the price currency.</p>

<p>A spot exchange rate is the currency exchange rate for immediate delivery, which for most currencies means the exchange of currencies takes place two days after the trade (2 business days). A forward exchange is a currency exchange rate for an exchange to be done in the future. Forward rates are quoted for various future dates.</p>
<p>1 month = 30 days in foreign exchange</p>
<p>Dealer quotes often include both bid and offer (ask) rates. For example, the euro could be quoted as $1.4124 - $1.4128. The bid price ($1.4124) is price at which the dealer will buy euros, and the offer price ($1.4128) is the price at which the dealer will sell euros.</p>
</section>
<section id="foreign-exchange-spread" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="foreign-exchange-spread">Foreign exchange spread</h3>
<p>The difference between the offer and bid price is called the spread. Spread are often stated as ‘pips’. One pip is 1/10,000. Dealers manage their foreign currency inventories by transacting in the interbank market (think of this as a wholesale market for currency). Spread are narrow in the interbank market.</p>
<p>The spread quoted by a dealer depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The spread in an interbank market for the same currency pair. - Dealer spreads vary directly with spreads quoted in the interbank market.</li>
<li>The size of transaction. - Larger, liquidity-demanding transactions generally get quoted a larger spread.</li>
<li>The relationship between the dealer and client. - Sometimes, dealer will give favorable rates to preferred clients based on other ongoing business relationships.</li>
</ul>
<p>The interbank spread on a currency pair depends on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currencies involved - Similar to stocks, high-volume currency pairs command lower spreads than do lower-volume currency pairs.</li>
<li>Time of day - The time overlap during the trading day when both the New York and London currency markets are open is considered the most liquidity time window; spreads are narrower during this period than at other times of the day.</li>
<li>Market volatility - Spreads are directly related to the exchange rate volatility of the currencies involved. Higher volatility leads to higher spreads to compensate market makers for the increased risk of holding those currencies.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these factors, spreads in forward exchange rate quotes increases with maturity. The reasons for this are: longer maturity contracts tend to be less liquid, counterparty credit risk in forward contracts increases with maturity, and interest rate risk in forward contracts increases with maturity.</p>

<p>An investor that choose to invest in the foreign currency without any additional return (the interest rate differential is offset by currency value changes) is not demanding a risk premium for the foreign currency risk. Hence, uncovered interest rate parity assume that the investor is risk-neutral.</p>
<p>If the forward rate is equal to the expected future spot rate, we say that the forward rate is an unbiased predictor of the future spot rate. In such an instance, <span class="math inline">\(F = E(S_{1})\)</span>; this is called forward rate parity. In this special case, if covered interest parity holds (and it will; by arbitrage) uncovered interest parity would also hold (and vice versa).</p>
<p>There is no reason that uncovered interest rate parity must hold in the short run, and indeed it typically does not. There is evidence that it does generally hold in the long run, so longer-term expected future spot rates based on uncovered interest rate parity are often used as forecasts of future exchange rates.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="purchasing-power-parity-ppp-구매력-평가">Purchasing power parity (PPP, 구매력 평가)</h3>
<p>The law of one price states that identical goods should have the same price in all locations.</p>
<p>However, that the law of one price does not hold in practice, due to the effects of frictions such as tariffs and transportation costs.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on individual products, absolute purchasing power parity (absolute PPP) compares the average price of a representative basket of consumption goods between countries. Absolute PPP requires only that the law of one price be correct on average, that is, for like baskets of goods in each country. <span class="math display">\[
\\S(A/B) = CPI(A) / CPI(B)
\]</span> In practice, even if the law of one price held for every good in two economies, absolute PPP might not hold because the weights (consumption patterns) of the various goods in the two economies may not be the same.</p>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="ex-ante-version-of-ppp">Ex-Ante Version of PPP</h3>
<p>The ex-ante version of purchasing power parity is the same as relative purchasing power parity except that it uses expected inflation instead of actual inflation.</p>
<p>Because there is no true arbitrage available to force relative PPP to hold, violations of relative PPP in the short run are common. However, because the evidence suggests that the relative form of PPP holds approximately in the long run, it remains a useful method for estimating the relationship between exchange rates and inflation rates.</p>

<p>If uncovered IRP does not hold</p>
<p>Uncovered interest rate parity states that a currency with a high interest rate should depreciated relative to a currency with a lower interest rate, so that an investor would earn the same return investing in either currency.</p>
<p>In a FX carry trade, an investor invests in a higher yielding currency using funds borrowed in a lower yielding currency. The lower yielding currency is called the funding currency.</p>
<p>The FX carry trade attempts to capture an interest rate differential and is a bet against uncovered interest rate parity. Carry trades typically perform well during low-volatility periods. Sometimes, higher yields attract larger capital flows, which in turn lead to an economic boom and appreciation (instead of depreciation) of the higher yielding currency. This could make the carry trade even more profitable, because the investor earns a return from currency appreciation in addition to the return from the interest rate spread.</p>
</section>
<section id="risks-of-the-carry-trade" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="risks-of-the-carry-trade">Risks of the carry trade</h3>
<p>The risk is the funding currency may appreciate significantly against the currency of the investment, which would reduce a trader’s profit-or even lead to a loss. Furthermore, the return distribution of the carry trade is not normal; it is characterized by negative skewness and excess kurtosis (i.e., fat tails), meaning that the probability of a large loss is higher than the probability implied under a normal distribution. We call this high probability of a large loss the crash risk of the carry trade.</p>
<p>As more investors follow and adopt the same strategy, the demand for high-yielding currency actually pushes it value up. However, with this herding behavior comes the risk that all investors may attempt to exit the trade at the same time. (This is especially true if investors use stop-loss orders in their carry trade.) During turbulent times, as investors exit their positions (i.e., a flight to safety), the high-yielding currency can experience a steep decline in value, generating large losses for traders pursuing FX carry trades.</p>

<p>Balance-of-payments accounting is a method used to keep track of transactions between a country and its international trading partners.</p>
<p>The current account measure the exchange of goods, the exchange of services, the exchange of investment income, and unilateral transfers (gifts to and from other nations).</p>
<p>The financial account (also known as the capital account) measures the flow of funds for debt and equity investment into and out of the country.</p>
<p>When a country experiences a current account deficit, it must generate a surplus in its capital account (or see its currency depreciate).

<p>Current account deficits lead to a depreciation of domestic currency via a variety of mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Flow supply / demand mechanisms - Current account deficits in a country increase the supply of that currency in the market (As exporters to that country convert their revenues into their own local currency). This puts downward pressure on the exchange value of that currency. The decrease in the value of the currency may restore the current account deficit to a balance-depending on the following factors:
<ul>
<li>The initial deficit - The larger the initial deficit, the larger the depreciation of domestic currency needed to restore current account balance.</li>
<li>The influence of exchange rates on domestic import and export prices - As a country’s current depreciates, the cost of imported goods increase. However, some of the increase in cost may not be passed on to consumers.</li>
<li>Price elasticity of demand of the traded goods - If the most important imports are relatively price inelastic, the quantity imported will not change.</li>

<li>Portfolio balance mechanism - Countries with current account surpluses usually have capital account deficits, which typically take the form of investments in countries with current account deficits. As a result of these flows of capital, investor countries may find their portfolios’ composition being dominated by few investee currencies. When investor countries decide to rebalance their investment portfolios, it can have a significant negative impact on the value of those investee country currencies.</li>
<li>Debt sustainability mechanism - A country running a current account deficit may be running a capital account surplus by borrowing from abroad. When the level of debt gets too high relative to GDP, investors may question the sustainability of this level of debt, leading to a rapid depreciation of the borrower’s currency.</li>

<p>An expansionary (restrictive) monetary policy would lead to depreciation (appreciation) of the domestic currency as stated previously.

<p>Monetary models only take into account the effect of monetary policy on exchange rates (fiscal policy effects are not considered). With the Mundell-Fleming model, we assume that inflation (price levels) play no role in exchange rate determination. Under monetary models, we assume that output is fixed, so that monetary policy primarily affects inflation, which in turn affects exchange rates.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Pure monetary model - Therefore an x% increase in the money supply leads to an x% increase in price levels and then to an x% depreciation of domestic currency.</li>
<li>Dornbusch overshooting model - This model assumes that prices are sticky (inflexible) in the short term and, hence, do not immediately reflect changes in monetary policy (in other words, PPP does not hold in the short term). The model concludes that exchange rates will overshoot the long-run PPP value in the short term. In the case of expansionary monetary policy, prices increase, but over time. Expansionary monetary policy leads to a decrease in interest rates-and a larger-than-PPP-implied depreciation of the domestic currency due to capital outflows. In the long term, exchange rates gradually increase toward their PPP implied values.</li>

<p>The portfolio balance approach focuses only on the effects of fiscal policy (and not monetary policy). While the Mundell-Fleming model focuses on the short-term implication of fiscal policy, the portfolio balance approach takes a long-term view and evaluates the effects of a sustainable fiscal deficit or surplus on currency values.</p>
<p>Combining the Mundell-Fleming and portfolio balance approaches, we find that in the short term, with free capital flows, an expansionary fiscal policy leads to domestic currency appreciation (via high interest rates). In the long term, the government has to reverse course (through tighter fiscal policy) leading to depreciation of the domestic currency. If the government does not reverse course, it will have to monetize its debt, which would also lead to depreciation of the domestic currency.</p>

<p>Positive growth in potential GDP indicates that future income will rise relative to current income. When consumers expect their incomes to rise, they increase current consumption and save less for future consumption (i.e., they are less likely to worry about funding their future consumption). To encourage consumers to delay consumption (i.e., to encourage savings), investments would have to offer a higher real rate of return. Therefore, higher potential GDP growth implies higher interest rates and higher real estate returns in general.</p>
<p>In the short term, the relationship between actual GDP and potential GDP may provide insight to both equity and fixed-income investors as to the state of the economy. For example, since actual GDP in excess of potential GDP results in rising prices, the gap between the two can be used as a forecast of inflationary pressures-useful to all investors but of particular concern to fixed-income investors. Furthermore, central banks are likely to adopt monetary policies consistent with the gap between potential output and actual output. When actual GPD growth rate is higher (lower) than potential GDP growth rate, concerns about inflation increase (decrease) and the central bank is more likely to follow restrictive (expansionary) monetary policy.</p>

<p>Capital investment on economic growth and labor productivity, consider a Cobb-Douglas production function which takes the form: <span class="math display">\[

\\\alpha\, and (1 - \alpha) = \text{the share of output allocated to capital (K) and labor (L), respectively } [\alpha\, and (1 - \alpha) \text{ are also referred to as capital's and labor's share of total factor cost, where } \alpha &lt; 1]

<p>Dividing both sides by L in the Cobb-Douglas production function, we can obtain the output per worker (labor productivity). <span class="math display">\[

<p>However, since <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> is less than one, additional capital has a diminishing effect on productivity: the lower the value of <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>, the lower the benefit of capital deepening.

<p>In stead state (i.e., equilibrium), the marginal product of capital (MPK = <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span>Y/K) and marginal cost of capital (i.e., the rental price of capital, r) are equal; hence: <span class="math display">\[

<p>Natural resources include both renewable resources, such as timber, and non-renewable resources, such as oil and gas.</p>
<p>One reason that limited natural resources do not necessarily constrain economic growth is that access to natural resources does not require ownership of resources.</p>
<p>The so-called “Dutch disease” refers to a situation where global demand for a country’s natural resources drives up the country’s currency values, making all exports more expensive and rendering other domestic industries uncompetitive in the global markets.</p>

<p>Physical capital is generally separated into infrastructure, computers, and telecommunication capital (ICT) and non-ICT capital (i.e., machinery, transportation, and non-residential construction). Empirical research has found a strong correlation between investment in physical capital and GDP growth rates.</p>
<p>This result may seen inconsistent given our previous discussion about capital deepening and diminishing marginal returns to capital. First, many countries (e.g., developing economies have relatively low capital to labor ratios, so increases in capital may still have significant impact on economic growth. Second, capital investment can take different forms. Some capital investment actually influence technological progress, thereby increasing TFP and economic growth. For example, acceleration of spending in the IT sector has created what are termed network externalities. Investment in IT networks may have multiplicative effects on productivity since IT network investment actually becomes more valuable as more people are connected to the network.</p>

<section id="classical-growth-theory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="classical-growth-theory">Classical growth theory</h3>
<p>Based on Malthusian economics, classical growth theory posits that, in the long-term, population growth increases whenever there are increases in per capita income above subsistence level due to an increase in capital or technological progress. Subsistence level is the minimum income needed to maintain life. Classical growth theory contends that growth in real GDP per capita is not permanent, because when real GDP per capita rises above the subsistence level, a population explosion occurs. Population growth leads to diminishing marginal returns to labor, which reduces productivity and drives GDP per capita back to the subsistence level. This mechanism would prevent long-term growth in per capita income. Classical growth theory is not supported by empirical evidence.</p>

<p>Neoclassical growth theory’s primary focus is on estimating the economy’s long-term steady state growth rate (sustainable growth rate or equilibrium growth rate). The economy is at equilibrium when the output-to-capital ratio is constant. Under neoclassical theory, population growth is independent of economic growth.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Sustainable growth of output per capita (or output per worker)(<span class="math inline">\(g^{*}\)</span>) is equal to the growth rate in technology (<span class="math inline">\(\theta\)</span>) divided by labor’s share of GDP (<span class="math inline">\(1 - \alpha\)</span>) <span class="math display">\[

</div>
<p>Under neoclassical theory:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capital deepening affects the level of output but not the growth rate in the long run. Capital deepening may temporarily increase the growth rate, but the growth rate will revert back to the sustainable level if there is no technological progress.</li>
<li>An economy’s growth rate will move towards its steady state regardless of the initial capital to labor ratio or level of technology.</li>
<li>In the steady state, the growth rate in productivity is a function only of the growth rate of technology and labor’s share of total output.</li>
<li>In the steady state, marginal product of capital (MPK) = <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> Y / K is constant, but marginal productivity is diminishing.</li>
<li>An increase in savings will only temporarily raise economic growth. However, countries with higher savings rates will enjoy higher capital to labor ratio and higher productivity.</li>
<li>Developing countries (with a lower level of capital per worker) will be impacted less by diminishing marginal productivity of capital, and hence have higher growth rates as compared to developed countries; there will be eventual convergence of per capita incomes.</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="endogenous-growth-theory" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="endogenous-growth-theory">Endogenous growth theory</h3>
<p>Endogenous growth theory contends that technological growth emerges as a result of investment in both physical and human capital (hence the name endogenous which means coming from within). Technological progress enhances productivity of both labor and capital. Unlike the neoclassical model, there is no steady state growth rate, so that increased investment can permanently increase the rate of growth.</p>
<p>Increasing R&amp;D investments, for example, results in benefits that also external to the firm making the R&amp;D investments. Those benefits raise the level of growth for the entire economy.</p>
<p>The endogenous growth model theorize that returns to capital are constant. The endogenous growth model implies that an increase in savings will permanently increase the growth rate.</p>
<p>Endogenous growth theory, on the other hand, assumes that capital investment (R&amp;D expenditures) may actually improve total factor productivity.</p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="los-11.j-explain-and-evaluate-convergence-hypothesis.">LOS 11.j: Explain and evaluate convergence hypothesis.</h2>
<p>The absolute convergence hypothesis states that less developed countries will achieve equal living standards over time. The conditional convergence hypothesis states that convergence in living standards will only occur for countries with the same savings rates, population growth rates, and production functions. Under the conditional convergence hypothesis, the growth rate will be higher for less developed countries until they catch up. Under the neoclassical model, once a developing country’s standard of living converges with that of developed countries, the growth rate will then stabilize to the same steady state growth rate as that of developed countries.</p>
<p>Club convergence. Under this hypothesis, countries may be part of a ‘club’ (i.e., countries with similar institutional features such as savings rates, financial markets, property rights, health and educational services, etc.). Under club convergence, pooper countries that are part of the club will grow rapidly to catch up with their richer peers. Countries can ‘join’ the club by making appropriate institutional changes. Those countries that are not part of the club may never achieve the higher standard of living.</p>

<p>Under endogenous growth theory, private sector investments in R&amp;D and knowledge capital benefit the society overall. The effects of ‘social returns’ of externalities are captured in the endogenous growth theory model, which concludes that economies may not reach a steady state growth but may permanently increase growth by expenditures that provide both benefits to the company (private benefits) and benefits to society (externalities).</p>

<p>Removing trade barriers and allowing for free flow of capital is likely to have the following benefits for countries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased investment from foreign savings</li>
<li>Allows focus on industries where the country has a comparative advantage</li>
<li>Increased markets for domestic products, resulting in economies of scale</li>
<li>Increased sharing of technology and higher total factor productivity growth</li>
<li>Increased competition leading to failure of inefficient firms and reallocation of their assets to more efficient uses</li>
</ul>
<p>The neoclassical model’s predictions in an open economy (i.e., an economy without any barriers to trade or capital flow) focus on the convergence. Since developing economies have not reached the point of significant diminishing returns on capital, they can attract capital through foreign investment and experience productivity growth as a result. Eventually, these economies will develop; their growth will slow and will converge to the steady state growth rate of developed economies.</p>
<p>The endogenous growth model also predicts greater growth with free trade and high mobility of capital since open markets foster increased innovation. As foreign competition increases, more efficient and innovation firms will survive. Those firms permanently increase the growth rate of the international economy by providing benefits beyond those simply captured by the firm. Economies of scale also increase output as firms serve larger markets and become more efficient.</p>

<p>Regulators can be government agencies or independent regulators. Independent regulators are given recognition by government agencies and have power to make rules and enforce them. However, independent regulators are usually not funded by the government and hence are politically independent.</p>
<p>Industry self-regulatory bodies (SRBs) are private organization that represent as well as regulate their members. Members of SRBs have to adhere to its rules. SRBs nonetheless are attractive in that they increase the overall level of regulatory resources, utilize the industry professionals with the requisite expertise, and allow regulators to devote resources to other priorities.</p>
<p>SRBs that are recognized by the government and given enforcement powers are self-regulating organizations (SROs). SROs are also independently funded and, as such, are politically independent. SROs regulate the behavior of their members and often provide public goods in the form of standards. Because of their recognition by the government, SROs fall within the category of independent regulators.</p>

<p>The regulatory capture is based upon the assumption that, regardless of the original purpose behind its establishment, a regulatory body will, at some point in time, be influenced or even possibly controlled by the industry that is being regulated. The rationale behind the theory is that regulators often have experience in the industry, and this affects the regulators’ ability to render impartial decisions.</p>
<p>Regulatory differences between jurisdictions can lead to regulatory competition, in which regulators compete to provide the most business-friendly regulatory environment.
