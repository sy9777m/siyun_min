<li>Constructing a time line showing future cash flows will help in solving many types of TVM problems. Cash flows occur at the end of the period depicted on the time line. The end of one period is the same as the beginning of the next period. For example, a cash flow at the beginning of Year 3 appears at time t = 2 on the time line.</li>

<ol type="1">
<li>Generate investment ideas</li>
<li>Analyze project ideas</li>
<li>Create firm-wide capital budget</li>
<li>Monitor decisions and conduct a post-audit</li>

Explain how the evaluation and selection of capital projects is affected by mutually exclusive projects, project sequencing, and capital rationing.</h3>
<ul>
<li>Acceptable independent projects can all be undertaken, while a firm must choose between or among mutually exclusive projects.</li>
<li>Project sequencing concerns the opportunities for future capital projects that may be created by undertaking a current project.</li>
<li>If a firm cannot undertake all profitable projects because of limited ability to raise capital, the firm should choose that group of fundable positive NPV projects with the highest total NPV.</li>

Calculate and interpret net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), payback period, discounted payback period, and profitability index (PI) of a single capital project.</h3>
<ul>
<li>NPV is the sum of present value of a project’s expected cash flows and represents the increase in firm value from undertaking a project. Positive NPV projects should be undertaken, but negative NPV projects are expected to decrease the value of the firm.</li>
<li>The IRR is the discount rate that equates the present values of the project’s expected cash inflows and outflows and, thus, is the discount rate for which the NPV of a project is zero. A project for which the IRR is greater (less) than the discount rate will have an NPV that is positive (negative) and should be accepted (not be accepted).</li>
<li>The payback (discounted payback) period is the number of years required to recover the original cost of the project (original cost of the project in present value terms).</li>
<li>The profitability index is the ratio of the present value of a project’s future cash flows to its initial cash outlay and is greater than one when a project’s NPV is positive.</li>

Explain the NPv profile, compare the NPV and IRR methods when evaluating independent and mutually exclusive projects, and describe the problems associated with each of the evaluation methods.</h3>
<ul>
<li>An NPV profile plots a project’s NPV as a function of the discount rate, and it intersects the horizontal axis (NPV = 0) at its IRR. If two NPV profiles intersect at some discount rate, that is the crossover rate, and different projects are preferred at discount rates higher and lower than the crossover rate.</li>

<ul>
<li>For projects with conventional cash flow patterns, the NPV and IRR methods produce the same accept / reject decision, but projects with unconventional cash flow patterns can produce multiple IRRs or no IRR.</li>
<li>Mutually exclusive projects can be ranked based on their NPVs, but rankings based on other methods will not necessarily maximize the value of the firm.</li>
