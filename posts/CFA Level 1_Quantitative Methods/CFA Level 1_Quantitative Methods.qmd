# Quantitative Methods

- 5~10% 정도 나옴
- Statistics + Finance 같은 느낌
- CFA의 core는 투자론
    - expected return은 올리고, risk는 내려야 함

# Describing Data Sets

## Population

- 모집단
- A population is defined as the set of all possible members of a stated group.

## Sample

- 표본
- A sample is defined as a subset of the population of interest.
- a sample statistics is used to measure a characteristics of a sample.

## Types of Measurement Scales

### Nominal scales

- Nominal scales are the level of measurement that contains the least information.
- 아무 의미 없는 번호 부여, 통계 값을 산출해도 아무 의미 없음
- ex) 키와 상관없이 무작위로 번호를 부여하면 평균을 내봐야 아무 의미가 없음

### Ordinal scales

- When working with an ordinal scale, every observation is assigned to one of several categories.
- 순서가 있는 번호 부여
- ex) 키가 큰 순으로 번호를 부여한다면, 평균이 낮을 수록 키가 크다는 의미

### Interval scales

- Interval scale measurements provide relative ranking like ordinal scales, plus the assurance that differences between scale values are equal.
- 크기가 상대적으로 의미를 가지나, 상대적 크기가 의미가 없음.
- ex) 섭씨 10도, 섭씨 20도는 상대적으로 20도가 10도보다 크다는 것은 알지만, 20도가 10도보다 2배 뜨겁다는 의미는 아니기 때문에 상대적 의미를 가지나, 절대적 의미가 없음

### Ratio scales

- Ratio scales provide ranking and equal differences between scale values, and they also have a true zero point as the origin.
- Order, interval, and ratios all make sense with a ratio scale.
- 크기가 상대적, 절대적으로 의미를 가짐.
- ex) 10달러, 20달러는 정확히 2배 차이의 절대적 의미를 가지고, 20달러는 10달러에 비해 상대적으로 크다.

## Parameter

- A measure used to describe a characteristics of a population is referred to as a parameter.

## Data를 설명하는 방법

- Table - Frequency Distribution
- Graph - Histogram, Frequency Polygon
- 수치로 표현
- table, graph는 시각적으로 데이터를 왜곡되게 보여 줄 수 있음

## Frequency distribution

- a tabular presentation of statistical data that aids the analysis of large data sets.
- 도수분포표
1. Defining the interval
2. Tally the observations and count the observations within each interval.

- Interval - 범위
- (Absolute) Frequency - 빈도
- Relative Frequency - 해당 interval의 전체 빈도 대비 비율
- Cumulative Frequency - 누적 빈도

## Graph

- histogram - 막대 그래프
- frequency polygon - 꺾은 선 그래프

## 수치표현 방법

- Central Tendency
    - mean
        - (arithmetic) mean
        - weighted mean
        - geometric mean
        - harmonic mean
    - median
    - mode
- Dispersion
- Skew
- Kurtosis

## Central Tendency

### Arithmetic Mean

- 산술평균
- sum of deviations of each observation from mean = 0
    - 산술평균은 무게중심이라 편차의 합이 항상 0
- All interval and ratio data sets have an arithmetic mean.
- All data values are considered and included in the arithmetic mean computation.
- A data set has only one arithmetic mean.
- Unusually large or small values can have a disproportionate effect on the computed value for the arithmetic mean.

### Weighted Mean

- 가중평균
- 값  * 비중의 평균

### Median

- 중간 값
- arithmetic mean은 outlier의 영향을 너무 크게 받음. 중간 값은 영향을 덜 받음.
- The median is the midpoint of a data set when the data is arranged in ascending or descending orders.
- The median is important because the arithmetic mean can be affected by extremely large or small values (outliers). When this occurs, the median is a better measure of central tendency than the mean because it is not affected by extreme values that may actually be the result of errors in the data.

### Mode

- 최빈 값
- 가장 많이 출몰한 값
- The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in a data set.

### Geometric Mean Return

- Geometric Mean과 Geometric Mean Return은 technically하게는 다르다고 하는 데 별도로 설명 안 하고 Geometric Mean Return만 배움
- 기하평균수익률

![./Untitled%203.png](./Untitled%203.png)

- The geometric mean is often used when calculating investment returns over multiple periods or when measuring compound growth rates.
- The geometric mean return can be computed using the following equation:

![./Untitled%204.png](./Untitled%204.png)

### Harmonic Mean

- 조화평균
- 안 가르침

## Mean

- For values that are not all equal: harmonic mean < geometric mean < arithmetic mean.

## Quantile

### Quartiles

- the distribution is divided into quarters.

### Quintile

- the distribution is divided into fifths.

### Decile

- the distribution is divided into tenths.

### Percentile

- the distribution is divided into hundredths (percents).

## Dispersion

- 산포도
- Dispersion is defined as the variability around the central tendency.

![./Untitled%205.png](./Untitled%205.png)

### Range

- range = max - min

### Mean Absolute Deviation(MAD)

- 편차의 절대 값 평균
- The mean absolute deviation (MAD) is the average of the absolute values of the deviations of individual observations from the arithmetic mean.

### Variance

- 분산
- 편차 제곱의 평균
- 표본의 분산은 분모가 n-1
- 숫자 자체로 설명이 불가능함. 다른 분산과의 크기 비교를 통해 상대적 크기를 비교하는 용도.

### Standard Deviation

- 표준편차
- 분산의 제곱근
- 마찬가지로 숫자 자체로 의미가 없음
- 다만 원 데이터와 단위가 같아서 Finance에서는 risk를 standard deviation을 사용

## Chebyshev's inequality

- Chebyshev's inequality states that for any set of observations.

## Coefficient of Variance (CV)

![./Untitled%207.png](./Untitled%207.png)

## Skewness

- 비대칭도
- A distribution is symmetrical if it is shaped identically on both sides of its mean.

![./Untitled%208.png](./Untitled%208.png)

- A positive skewed distribution is characterized by many outliers in the upper region, or right tail. A positively skewed distribution is said to be skewed right because of its relatively long upper (right) tail.
- A negative skewed distribution has a disproportionately large amount of outliers that fall within its lower (left) tail. A negatively skewed distribution is said to be skewed left because of its log lower tail.

## Kurtosis

- 첨도

![./Untitled%209.png](./Untitled%209.png)

- Kurtosis is a measure of the degree to which a distribution is more or less "peaked" than a normal distribution.

## Conditional and Joint Probabilities

- A random variable is an uncertain quantity / number.
- An outcome is an observed value of a random variable.
- An event is a single outcome or a set of outcomes.
- Mutually exclusive events are events that cannot both happen at the same time.
- Exhaustive events are those that include all possible outcomes.

![./Untitled%2010.png](./Untitled%2010.png)

## Properties of probability

- The probability of occurrence of any event is between 0 and 1.
- If a set of events is mutually exclusive and exhaustive, the probabilities of those events sum to 1.

## Exclusive, Exhaustive

![./Untitled%2011.png](./Untitled%2011.png)

## Objective probabilities

- An empirical probability is established by analyzing past data.
- A priori probability is determined using a formal reasoning and inspection process.
- A subjective probability is the least formal method of developing probabilities and involves the use of personal judgment.

![./Untitled%2012.png](./Untitled%2012.png)

## Conditional Probability

- 조건부 확률
- Unconditional probability refers to the probability of an event regardless of the past or future occurrence of other events.
- A conditional probability is one where the occurrence of one event affects the probability of the occurrence of another event.

![./Untitled%2013.png](./Untitled%2013.png)

![./Untitled%2014.png](./Untitled%2014.png)

## Joint probability

![./Untitled%2015.png](./Untitled%2015.png)

![./Untitled%2016.png](./Untitled%2016.png)

![./Untitled%2017.png](./Untitled%2017.png)

## Multiplication and additional rule of probability

- The multiplication rule of probability is used to determine the joint probability of two events.
- The additional rule of probability is used to determine the probability that as least one of two events will occur.

![./Untitled%2018.png](./Untitled%2018.png)

## Calculating the probability that at least one of two events will occur

![./Untitled%2019.png](./Untitled%2019.png)

- For mutually exclusive events, where the joint probability is zero, the probability that either A or B will occur is simply the sum of the unconditional probabilities for each event.

## Calculating a joint probability of any number of independent events

- When dealing with independent events, the word and indicates multiplication, and the word or indicates addition.

![./Untitled%2020.png](./Untitled%2020.png)

## Independent events

- Independent events refer to events for which the occurrence of one has no influence on the occurrence of the others.

![./Untitled%2021.png](./Untitled%2021.png)

## Bayes' Formula

![./Untitled%2022.png](./Untitled%2022.png)

## Expected Value

![./Untitled%2023.png](./Untitled%2023.png)

- Expected values or returns can be calculated using conditional probabilities.

## Covariance / Correlation

- Finance에서 중요

![./Untitled%2026.png](./Untitled%2026.png)

### Covariance

- a measure of how two assets move together.
- The covariance is a general representation of the same concept as the variance.

![./Untitled%2027.png](./Untitled%2027.png)

- The covariance may range from negative infinity to positive infinity.

![./Untitled%2028.png](./Untitled%2028.png)

### Correlation coefficient

- 상관계수
- Correlation measures the strength of the linear relationship between two random variables.
- Correlation has no units.
- The correlation ranges from -1 to +1.
- If correlation is 1.0, the random variables have perfect positive correlation.
- If correlation is -1.0, the random variables have perfect negative correlation.

![./Untitled%2029.png](./Untitled%2029.png)

### Spurious correlation

- correlation that is either the result of chance or present due to changes in both variables over time that is caused by their association with a third variable.
