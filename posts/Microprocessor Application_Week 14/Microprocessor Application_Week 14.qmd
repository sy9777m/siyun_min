# Week 14

# Acceleration?

- x100000000 improvement in just five years!

# Evolution of Bitcoin miner

From 2009, the amount of hashing power in the Bitcoin network has grown exponentially

- 2009: the miners hashing 8 million times per second
- 2010: 116,000 million times per second
- 2014: 10,000,000,000 million times per second

It is mostly done by the competition in the hardware used in the network because the SHA-256 algorithm is hard to be accelerate in SW

- 2010: CPU → GPU
- 2011: GPU → FPGA
- 2013: FPGA → ASIC

# How to make NN fast?

optimize network

- use of better filter set
- topology pruning- edges, nodes, depths…

use of better machine

- GPU, TPU, VLIW, etc…

# Operations in CNN

Activation function

- Input: input FMAP, filter weight
- output: output FMAP

# Computational acceleration

Memory access consumes order of magnitude higher resources compared to the computation

But, anyhow, 90% of computation is occupied by convolution

- convolution is the sequence of Dot-Product (vector matrix multiplication)
- how to accelerate the dot-product?

# Performance metrics

CPI - Cycles per instruction (clock cycles per instruction, clocks per instruction, or CPI) is one aspect of a processor’s performance: the average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment

It is the multiplicative inverse of instructions per cycle (IPC)

MIPS: million instructions per second

# Discussion

How can CPI value be smaller than 1.00?

- effect of pipeline

Why does “Branch (BL)” instruction has 1.00 CPI value?

- result of a stall in pipeline

# Dot-product engine

## Dot-product

$$
a • b = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{a_i b_i} = a_1b_1 + a_2b_2 + ... + a_nb_n
$$

How many computation do we need?

- For 2x2 matrix input and weight
- 4 multiplication and 3 addition

![Untitled](./Untitled%209.png)

Multiply accumulate (MAC) unit

- Accept multiple inputs and calculate at once

For 2x2 matrix input and weight in the previous page,

- When we need 2 cycles for MUL, 1 cycle for ADD
- A dot-product needs 11 cycles in total

If dot-product engine can obtain the result in a cycle

and the dot-product occupy 90% of processor time,

Then we can save 0.9 * 10/11 = 81.8% of CPU time!!
