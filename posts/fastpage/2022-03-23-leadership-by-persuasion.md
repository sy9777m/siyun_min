# Influencing Attitudes

## Getting people to have appropriately positive attitudes

Why aren't people already doing this behavior? One possible answer is they don't think it is a good idea.

### 1. Consequence-based arguments

Consequences, outcomes, are a natural source of good reasons for doing something. Persuade people by giving them consequences of their behaviors.

### 2. Consequence desirability

Don't too easily assume you know what consequences will be most persuasive to your audience. The argument that seems best to you, the argument that seems most persuative to you.

### 3. Consequence likelihood

People may have doubts about whether the outcomes you suggested will actually occur. Describe the underlying mechanism that is explained to people how the advocated action comes to produce the claimed consequences.

### 4. Addressing counterarguments

Make your own positive arguments. If in addition to advancing those supportive arguments, you also undertake refutation of opposing arguments, you will be more persuasive. The best strategy is to try to overwhelm those opposing considerations by invoking all of your supportive arguments, all your positive points.

# Influencing Social Factors

## Social considerations are a barrier

### 1. Changing descriptive norms

The descriptive norm is the person's perception of whether other people perform the behavior. People can be influenced by social considerations, factors connected with people' perceptions of what other people think about what you're doing. Persuade people to do by conveying other people have done it.

### 2. De-emphasizing prescriptive norm

Prescriptive norm perceptions are people's sense of what other people think they should do that's preventing them from going forward. Suggest that in making their decision, they should place more weight on their own attitudes than on what other people think. De-emphasize people's prescriptive norm to persuade them to do something.

### 3. Changing prescriptive norms

Emphasize people's own attitude more than what other people think they should do. Also, find someone who has a great influence on people you want to persuade, and make them persuaded.

# Influcencing Perceived Ability

## People's perceived ability to perform the behavior

Sometimes people have the appropriate positive attitudes and the social considerations about what other people think or do are all positive. But people don't think they can perform the behavior. Maybe they don't know how to perform the behavior. And so, they don't even try.

### The importance of perceived ability

One barrier to people doing what you want can be their perceived ability to perform the behavior. If I want to make them to act, I should make it easier than what they think.

### Removing obstacles

There are two kinds of obstacles that people might face and so two kinds that you might remove.
1. Sometimes people just lack information that's relevant to behavioral performance.
2. The second kind of obstacle is substantice, material, not just a lack of information, but something beyond that.

There are three abstract strategies, three general ways of potentially influencing perceived behavioral ability.

1. The first strategy is directly removing obstacles to performing the behavior

### Rehearsal and modeling

The second and third strategies are rehearsal and modeling. Provide opportunities to people for rehearsal or practice of the behavior. Show them someone who already successfully perform the behavior before.

# Converting Intentions into Action

## Addressing people's ability to perform the behavior

Sometimes, a persuader faces the task of helping people convert their intentions to behavior.

### 1. Prompt

A prompt is a simple cue that makes performance of the behavior salient, brings it into conscious awareness. However, prompt won't always work. There are right kinds of situations they can be very useful. At least two necessary conditions for a prompt to be successful:
1. The preson must already be willing to do the behavior.
2. Perceived behavioral ability must be sufficiently high.

### 2. Explicit planning

Specify when and where and how people are doing to do the behavior. Specific concrete intention is much more effective than abstract general intention.

Encouraging explicit planning interventions to work, there are at least two conditions to be met:
1. People must already have the appropriate abstract intention.
2. Perceived behavioral ability must be sufficiently high.

### 3. Inducing guilt

Make people to feel bad about their inconsistency. If people are going to experience these negative feelings, guilt, hypocrisy, dissonance, two things have to be salient to them at the same time.
1. Their existing positive attitudes and intentions on the one hand.
2. Their inconsistent behaviors on the other.

Feeling uncomfortable is the motivation for people to change their behavior.

However, this is a dangerous strategy. It can produce negative reactions.
1. People often react negatively to overt attempts to make them feel guilt, and that can make them resistant to change.
2. People's perceived behavioral ability is not sufficiently high.

## Summary

Why don't people already doing what I want?
1. Because they don't think it is a good idea. - attitude
2. Because they are influenced by their environments - social factors
3. Because they don't think they are able to do that - perceived ability
4. Because they have not a specific plan, but a vague intention - intentions without action
