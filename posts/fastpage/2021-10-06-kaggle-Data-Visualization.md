## Hello, Seaborn

## Line Charts

`sns.lineplot` tells the notebook that we want to create a line chart.

The first line of code sets the size of the figure to `14` inches (in width) by `6` inches (in height). To set the size of *any figure*, you need only copy the same line of code as it appears. Then, if you'd like to use a custom size, change the provided values of `14` and `6` to the desired width and height.

### Plot a subset of the data

## Bar Charts and Heatmaps

`annot=True` - This ensures that the values for each cell appear on the chart.

## Scatter Plots

To double-check the strength of this relationship, you might like to add a **regression line**, or the line that best fits the data. We do this by changing the command to `sns.regplot`.

### Color-coded scatter plots

![image-20211006175155413](/Kevin_Min/images/2021-10-06-kaggle-Data-Visualization/image-20211006175155413.png)

![image-20211006175219474](/Kevin_Min/images/2021-10-06-kaggle-Data-Visualization/image-20211006175219474.png)

We'll refer to this plot type as a **categorical scatter plot**, and we build it with the `sns.swarmplot` command.

## Distribution

### Histogram

![image-20211006180210150](/Kevin_Min/images/2021-10-06-kaggle-Data-Visualization/image-20211006180210150.png)

We customize the behavior of the command with two additional pieces of information:

-   `a=` chooses the column we'd like to plot (*in this case, we chose `'Petal Length (cm)'`*).
-   `kde=False` is something we'll always provide when creating a histogram, as leaving it out will create a slightly different plot.

### Density plot

### 2D KDE plots

### Color-coded plots

In this case, the legend does not automatically appear on the plot. To force it to show (for any plot type), we can always use `plt.legend()`.

## Choosing Plot Types and Custom Styles

![img](/Kevin_Min/images/2021-10-06-kaggle-Data-Visualization/2VmgDnF.png)

Since it's not always easy to decide how to best tell the story behind your data, we've broken the chart types into three broad categories to help with this.

-   Trends

    \- A trend is defined as a pattern of change.

    -   `sns.lineplot` - **Line charts** are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group.

-   Relationship

    \- There are many different chart types that you can use to understand relationships between variables in your data.

    -   `sns.barplot` - **Bar charts** are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.
    -   `sns.heatmap` - **Heatmaps** can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers.
    -   `sns.scatterplot` - **Scatter plots** show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third [categorical variable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_variable).
    -   `sns.regplot` - Including a **regression line** in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables.
    -   `sns.lmplot` - This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple, color-coded groups.
    -   `sns.swarmplot` - **Categorical scatter plots** show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.

-   Distribution

    \- We visualize distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are.

    -   `sns.distplot` - **Histograms** show the distribution of a single numerical variable.
    -   `sns.kdeplot` - **KDE plots** (or **2D KDE plots**) show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable (or two numerical variables).
    -   `sns.jointplot` - This command is useful for simultaneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable.

Seaborn has five different themes: (1)`"darkgrid"`, (2)`"whitegrid"`, (3)`"dark"`, (4)`"white"`, and (5)`"ticks"`, and you need only use a command similar to the one in the code cell above (with the chosen theme filled in) to change it.
