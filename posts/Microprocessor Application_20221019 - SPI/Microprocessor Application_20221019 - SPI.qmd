# 20221019 - SPI

# SPI basics

A communication protocol using 4 wires

- Also known as a 4 wire bus

Used to communicate across small distances

Multiple slaves, single master

Synchronized

![Untitled](./Untitled.png)

Always full duplex

- Communicating in two directions at the same time
- transmission need not be meaningful

Multiple Mbps transmission speed

Transfers data in 4 to 16 bit characters

Multiple slaves

- Daisy-chaining possible

# SPI protocols

Wires

- Both signals happen for every transmission
    - Master Out Slave In (MOSI) - carries data out of Master to Slave
    - Master In Slave Out (MISO) - carries data from Slave to Master
- System clock (SCLK) - Master produced clock to synchronize data transfer
- /SS (Slave Select 1…N) - Unique line to select a slave

Shift registers shift in and out data - Master shifts out data to Slave, and shift in data from Slave

# Slave selection

Dedicated slave selection vs. Daisy chaining

- Master Set Slave Select low with /SS_N signals
- Daisy chaining - MOSI - (DIN-DOUT) - (DIN-DOUT)…

# Pros and Cons

## Pros

Fast for point-to-point connections

Easily allows streaming/Constant data inflow

No addressing/Simple to implement

Everyone supports it

## Cons

SS makes multiple slaves very complicated

No acknowledgement ability

No inherent arbitration

No flow control
