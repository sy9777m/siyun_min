# 20221123 - Acceleration of Neural Network

# Acceleration?

Evolution of Bitcoin miner

x100000000 improvement if just five years!

# Evolution of Bitcoin miner

From 2009, the amount of hashing power in the Bitcoin network has grown exponentially

- 2009: the miners hashing 8 million times per second
- 2010: 116,000 million times per second
- 2014: 10,000,000,000 million times per second

It is mostly done by the competition in the hardware used in the network because the SHA-256 algorithm is hard to be accelerate in SW.

- 2010: CPU → GPU
- 2011: GPU → FPGA
- 2013: FPGA → ASIC

# How to make NN fast?

Optimize network

- USe of better filter set
- Topology pruning: edges, nodes, depths

Use of batter mathcine

- GPU, TPU, VLIW, etc…

# Operations in CNN

## terms

N - Number of input fmaps/output fmaps (batch size)

C - Number of 2-D input fmaps/filters (channels)

H - Height of input fmap (activations)

W - Width of input fmap (activations)

R - Height of 2-D filter (Weights)

S - Width of 2-D filter (weights)

M - Number of 2-D output fmaps (channels)

E - Height of output fmap (activations)

F - Width of output fmap (activations)

## Activation function

Input - input FMAP, filter weight

Output - output FMAP

# What should be accelerated?

# Computational acceleration

Memory access consumes order of magnitude higher resources compared to the computation.

But, anyhow, 90% of computation is occupied by convolution

- Convolution is the sequence of Dot-Product (vector matrix multiplication)
- How to accelerate the dot-product?

# Performance metrics

CPI - Cycles per instruction (clock cycles per instruction, clocks per instruction, or CPI) is one aspect of a processor’s performance

- The average number of clock cycles per instruction for a program or program fragment

It is the multiplicative inverse of instructions per cycle (IPC)

MIPS - Million instructions per second

# Discussion

How can CPI value be smaller than 1.00?

- Effect of pipeline

Why does “Branch (BL)” instruction has 1.00 CPI value?

- Result of a stall in pipeline
