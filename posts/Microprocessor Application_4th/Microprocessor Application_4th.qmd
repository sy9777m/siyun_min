# Address space

Microprocessor thinks the everything around them is a just address.

External devices are located in the space of address - memory map!

Addressable range and address bus width

- 16bit address → $2^{16}$ of objects can be identified.

# Memory map

Address decoding

- Address space with multiple chip devices

ex) Implementing 64KB memory with 4KB devices

- 64 / 4 = 16 * 4KB RAM are required.

How about the address?

- 4K = $4 \times 2^{10} = 2^{12}$ → 12 bits for byte-wise addressing
- 64K = $64 \times 2^{10} = 2^{12}$ → 16 bits for byte-wise addressing
