- 현금흐름, 가치평가, 가격변동이유를 배움
- 채권 공부는 상품을 공부하는 것
- The most common type of fixed-income security is a bond that promises to make a series of interest payments in fixed amounts and to repay the principal amount at maturity.
- When market interest rates increase, the value of such bonds decrease because the present value of a bon's promised cash flows decreases when a higher discount rate used.
- Bonds are rated based on their relative probability of default (failure to make promised payments). Because investors prefer bonds with lower probability of default, bonds with lower credit quality must offer investors higher yields to compensate for the greater probability of default. Other things equal, a decrease in a bond's rating (an increased probability of default) will decrease the price of the bond, thus increasing its yield.
- Promised cashflow
    - timing, size가 정해져있음

## LOS 42.a: Describe basic features of a fixed-income security.

### Issuers of Bonds

- Corporations
- Sovereign national governments
    - 중앙정부
- Non-sovereign governments
    - 지방정부
- Quasi-government entities
    - 정부투자기관, 공기업
- Supranational entities
    - World Bank, IMF
- 주로 Corporations, Sovereign national governments 발행 채권 공부

### Bond Maturity

- The maturity date of a bond is the date on which the principal is to be repaid.
- The time remaining until maturity is referred to as the term to maturity or tenor of a bond.
- Bonds that have no maturity date are called perpetual bonds.
    - 영구채
- Bonds with original maturities of one year or less are referred to as money market securities.
    - Money market - 단기자금시장
- Bonds with original maturities of more than one year are referred to as capital market securities.
    - Capital market - 장기자금시장

### Par Value

![./Untitled%201.png](./Untitled%201.png)

- The par value of a bond is the principal amount that will be repaid at maturity.
- face value, maturity value, redemption value, principal value
- Bonds can have a par value of any amount, and their prices and quoted as a percentage of par. A bond with a par value of $1,000 quoted at 98 is selling for $980.
    - price quotation - 가격공시
    - par value를 100으로 놓고 단위를 떼놓고 quoted 되어있다고 함
- A bond that is selling for more than its par value is said to be trading at a premium to par;
- a bond that is selling at less than its par value is said to be trading at a discount to par;
- a bond that is selling for exactly its par value is said to be trading at par.

### Coupon Payments

![./Untitled%202.png](./Untitled%202.png)

- The coupon rate on a bond is the annual percentage of its par value that will be paid to bondholders.
- Some bonds make coupon interest payments annually, while others make semiannual, quarterly, or monthly payments.
- coupon은 반드시 1년에 지급하는 총 이자액 기준
    - 지급을 annual, semiannual, quarterly로 할 수 있는 것

![./Untitled%203.png](./Untitled%203.png)

- Some bonds pay no interest prior to maturity and are called zero-coupon bonds or pure discount bonds.
    - Pure discount refers to the fact that these bonds are sold at a discount to their par value and the interest is all paid at maturity when bondholders receive the par value.

### Currencies

- A dual-currency bond makes coupon interest payments in one currency and the principal repayment at maturity in another currency.
- A currency option bond gives bondholders a choice of which of two currencies they would like to receive their payments in.

## LOS 42.b: Describe content of a bond indenture.

## LOS 42.c: Compare affirmative and negative covenants and identify examples of each.

- bond indenture는 채권발행계약서
- The legal contract between the bond issuer (borrower) and bondholders (lenders) is called a trust deed, bond indenture.
- The indenture defines the obligations of and restrictions on the borrower and forms the basis for all future transactions between the bondholder and the issuer.

### Negative covenants

- 금지조항, 행위제한
- Negative covenants include restrictions on asset sales (the company can't sell assets that have been pledged as collateral), negative pledge of collateral (the company can't claim that the same assets back several debt issues simultaneously) ,and restrictions on additional borrowings (the company can't borrow additional money unless certain financial conditions are met).

### Affirmative covenants

- 준수조항
- Common affirmative covenants are to make timely interest and principal payments to bondholders, to insure and maintain assets, and to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

## LOS 42.d: Describe how legal, regulatory, and tax considerations affect the issuance and trading of fixed-income securities.

![./Untitled%204.png](./Untitled%204.png)

- Bonds are subject to different legal and regulatory requirements depending on where they are issued and traded. Bonds issued by a firm domiciled in a country and also traded in that country's currency are referred to as domestic bonds.
- Bonds issued by a firm incorporated in a foreign country that trade on the national bond market of another country in that country's currency are referred to as foreign bonds.
- Eurobonds are issued outside the jurisdiction of any one country and denominated in a currency different from the currency of the countries in which they are sold
- Eurobonds that trade in the national bond market of a country other than the country that issues the currency the bond is denominated in, and in the Eurobond market, are referred to as global bonds.
    - 글로벌 채권이라고도 부름
- Other legal and regulatory issues addressed in a trust deed include:
    - Any additional features that increase the probability of repayment (credit enhancements)
        - 신용보강장치

### Issuing entities

- Bonds are issued by several types of legal entities, and bondholders must be aware of which entity has actually promised to make the interest and principal payments.
- Sometimes an entity is created solely for the purpose of owning specific assets and issuing bonds to provide the funds to purchase the assets.
    - ABS, securitized bond

### Sources of repayment

- Sovereign bonds are typically repaid by the tax receipts of the issuing country.Bonds issued by non-sovereign government entities are repaid by either general taxes, revenues of a specific project, or by special taxes or fees dedicated to bond repayment.
- Corporate bonds are generally repaid from cash generated by the firm's operations.
- Securitized bonds are repaid from the cash flows of the financial assets owned by the SPE.
    - ABS

### Collateral and credit enhancements

- Unsecured bonds represent a claim to the overall assets and cash flows of the issuer.
    - debenture
    - 무담보채권, 순수신용채
- Secured bonds are backed by a claim to specific assets of a corporation, which reduces their risk of default and, consequently, the yield that investors require on the bonds.
    - Because they are backed by collateral, secured bonds are senior to unsecured bonds.
    - 담보 때문에 선순위라는 의미
- Equipment trust certificates are debt securities backed by equipment such as railroad cars and oil drilling rigs.
- Collateral trust bonds are backed by financial assets, such as stocks and (other) bonds.
    - Debentures refers to unsecured debt.
- The most common type of securitized bond is a mortgage-backed security (MBS).
    - ABS

### Taxation of Bond Income

![./Untitled%205.png](./Untitled%205.png)

- Most often, the interest income paid to bondholders is taxed as ordinary income at the same rate as wage and salary income.
- The interest income from bonds issued by municipal governments in the United States, however, is most often exempt from national income tax and often from nay state income tax in the state of issue.
    - 미국 지방채는 비과세되는 경우가 종종 있는데, CFA에서는 무조건 비과세라고 생각하면 됨
- When a bondholder sells a coupon bond prior to maturity, it may be at a gain or a loss relative to its purchase price. Such gains and losses are considered capital gains income (rather than ordinary taxable income).
- Pure-discount bonds and other bonds sold at significant discount to par when issued are termed original issue discount (OID) bonds. Because the gains over an OID bond's tenor as the price moves towards par value are really interest income, these bonds can generate a tax liability even when no cash interest payment has been made.

## Callable bond

> 42.f. Describe contingency provisions affecting the timing and / or nature of cash flows of fixed-income securities and identify whether such provisions benefit the borrowers or the lender.
> 

![./Untitled%2010.png](./Untitled%2010.png)

- callable bond는 call exercise price가 가격 상한선이 되어버림
    - 이 경우를 fixed price call이라고 함
- make-whole call이라는 것이 있는데, market value와 principal + accrued interest의 합 중 최대 값을 call exercise price로 인정해주는 callable bond가 있음
    - 보통 적대적 인수합병을 방어하는 목적으로 발행
- A contingency provision in a contract describes an action that may be taken if an event (the contingency) actually occurs. Contingency provisions in bond indentures are referred to as embedded options, embedded in the sense that they are an integral part of the bond contract and are not a separate security.
- Some embedded options are exercisable at the option of the issuer of the bond and, therefore, are valuable to the issuer; others are exercisable at the option of the purchaser of the bond and, thus, have value to the bondholders.
- A call option gives the issuer the right to redeem all or part of a bond issue at a specific price (call price) if they choose to.
- A call option has value to the issuer because it gives the issuer the right to redeem the bond and issue a new bond (borrow) if the market yield on the bond declines. This could occur either because interest rates in general have decreased or because the credit quality of the bond has increased (default risk has decreased).
- option에는 3가지 스타일이 있음
    - American style - the bonds an be called anytime after the first call date.
    - European style - the bonds can only be called on the call date specified.
    - Bermuda style - the bonds can be called on specified dates after the first call date, often on coupon payment dates.
- callable bond = straight bond - call option value
    - long callable bond = long straight bond + short call option

## Convertible bond

![./Untitled%2011.png](./Untitled%2011.png)

## Warrants

- An alternative way to give bondholders an opportunity for additional returns when the firm's common shares increase in value is to include warrants with straight bonds when they are issued.
- Warrants give their holders the right to buy the firm's common shares at a given price over a given period of time.

## Contingent Convertible Bonds

- CoCo bond
- convert from debt to common equity automatically if a specific event occurs.

- 어떤 채권이 발행 당시 coupon rate 10%였는데, 현재 market yield가 8%라면, 위와 같은 형태로 차이가 발생한 coupon의 합만큼을 발행 당시 채권의 가격과 현재 market value의 차이로 볼 수 있다.

## Price yield curve

> 44.b. Identify the relationships among a bond's price, coupon rate, maturity, and market discount rate (yield-to-maturity).
> 

![./Untitled%2019.png](./Untitled%2019.png)

- 채권의 수익률에 대한 가격 곡선은 원점에 볼록(convex)해서 같은 수익률 변화에도 불구하고 가격 상승, 하락 폭이 비대칭적이다.
1. At a point in time, a decrease (increase) in a bond's YTM will increase (decrease) its price.
2. If a bond's coupon rate is greater than its YTM, its price will be at a premium to par value. If a bond's coupon rate is less than its YTM, its price will be at a discount to par value.
3. The percentage decrease in value when the YTM increases by a given amount is smaller than the increase in value when the YTM decreases by the same amount (the price-yield relationship is convex)
4. Other things equal, the price of a bond with a lower coupon rate is more sensitive to a change in yield than is the price of a bond with a higher coupon rate.
5. Other things equal, the price of a bond with a longer maturity is more sensitive to a change in yield than is the price of a bond with a shorter maturity.
- Volatility는 ZCB > coupon bond, longer maturity > shorter maturity

### Relationship between price and maturity

![./Untitled%2020.png](./Untitled%2020.png)

![./Untitled%2021.png](./Untitled%2021.png)

![./Untitled%2022.png](./Untitled%2022.png)

- 만기에 다가올수록 당시 발행한 YTM이 어쨌든, par value에 수렴한다.
- 이 때 par value에 수렴하기 때문에 발생하는 가격 차이는 capital gain or loss가 아니며, capital gain or loss는 파는 시점의 par value와 판매한 YTM을 기준으로 한 value의 차이를 capital gain이라고 한다.

## Spot rates and accrued interest

![./Untitled%2023.png](./Untitled%2023.png)

- 만약 3년 만기 채권의 YTM이 있다면, 이 YTM은 사실상 해당 채권의 IRR로 중간 coupon에 대한 재투자 가정이 포함되어 있다.
- 그러나 이 채권의 현금흐름을 각각의 만기를 가진 ZCB로 쪼개서 해당 ZCB의 현재 가치를 구하는 이자율을 spot rate라고 하는데, 이 방식으로 계산하면 coupon에 대한 재투자 가정이 없어서 순수한 할인율을 뽑아낼 수 있다.
- 그러나 YTM을 사용하여 계산한 채권 가격과 spot rate를 사용하여 계산한 채권 가격은 같으므로, spot rate로 YTM을 역산할 수 있다.

## 투자하다

![./Untitled%2024.png](./Untitled%2024.png)

- 투자하다라는 것은 포지션을 잡다라는 의미로, 포지션에는 롱, 숏 두 개만 있음
- 롱은 투자한 자산이 오르면 수익을 보고, 숏은 투자한 자산이 내리면 수익을 봄
- 투자한 자산은 가격 그 자체의 수준이 오르고 내리거나 가격의 변동성이 오르고 내릴 수 있음

## Arbitrage

![./Untitled%2025.png](./Untitled%2025.png)

- 차익거래 이익이라는 것은 무위험 차익으로, 내 자산은 하나도 사용하지 않고 오로지 레버리지만 사용해서 무위험 수익을 얻어야 차익거래이다.
- 초과 공급 자산을 빌려서 숏 포지션을 잡고, 초과수요 자산의 롱 포지션을 잡으면 그 순간 차익거래가 발생한다. 이 차익거래 기회가 없어질 때까지 포지션을 유지하면 시장은 균형 시장으로 수렴한다.

![./Untitled%2030.png](./Untitled%2030.png)

![./Untitled%2031.png](./Untitled%2031.png)

- The option-adjusted yield is calculated by adding the value of the call option to the bond's current flat price.
- option-adjusted yield는 callable bond의 가격에 call option 가격을 더해서 계산한 값을 구하는 YTM을 의미

### floating-rate note yields

![./Untitled%2032.png](./Untitled%2032.png)

- t = 0 시점에서 고정된 마진은 quoted margin, discount margin, required margin at t = 0이라고 함
- 해당 마진은 credit quality를 나타냄, 앞으로 변하지 않음
- 그러나 시간이 지나서 credit quality에 변화가 생겨서 시장에서 해당 margin이 오르는 경우가 있는데 이 때 face value로 돌아오기 위한 margin을 계산하면 이 것이 바로 해당 시점의 Required margin
- The values of floating rate notes (FRNs) are more stable than hose of fixed-rate debt of similar maturity because the coupon interest rates are reset periodically based on a reference rate.
- Recall that the coupon rate on a floating-rate note is the reference rate plus or minus a margin based on a credit risk of the bond relative to the credit risk of the reference rate instruement.
- If an FRN is issued by a company that has more (less) credit risk than the banks quoting LIBOR, a margin is added to (subtracted from) LIBOR, the reference rate. The liquidity of an FRN and its tax treatment can also affect the margin.
- We call the margin used to calculate the bond coupon payments the quoted margin.
- We call the margin required to return the FRN to its par value the required margin (also called the discount margin).
- When the credit quality of an FRN is unchanged, the quoted margin is equal to the required margin and the FRN returns to its par value at each reset date when the next coupon payment is reset to the current market rate (plus or minus the appropriate margin).
- If the credit quality of the issuer decrease, the quoted margin will be less than the required margin and the FRN will sell at a discount to its par value. If credit quality has improved, the quoted margin will be greater than the required margin and the FRN will sell at a premium to its par value.

## LOs 42.e: Describe how cash flows of fixed-income securities are structured.

- A typical bond has a bullet structure. Periodic interest payments (coupon payments) are made over the life of the bond, and the principal value is paid with the final interest payment at maturity. The interest payments are referred to as the bond's coupons. When the final payment includes a lump sum in addition to the final period's interest, it is referred to as a balloon payment.
    - bullet structure - 만기일시상환구조
    - 막판에 크게 받는 것을 일컬어 balloon payment라고 함

![./Untitled%2034.png](./Untitled%2034.png)

- A loan structure in which the periodic payments include both interest and some repayment of principal (the amount borrowed) is called an amortizing loan. If a bond (loan) is fully amortizing, this means the principal is fully paid off when the last periodic payment is made.
    - 원금 분할상환
    - 상환하면 할 수록 이자가 줄어들고 원금이 커지는 구조 (같은 금액을 상환하더라도)
- partially amortizing
    - the final payment includes just the remaining unamortized principal amount rather than the full principal amount.
    - 마지막 기일에 원금을 조금 더 크게 갚는 구조

![./Untitled%2035.png](./Untitled%2035.png)

![./Untitled%2036.png](./Untitled%2036.png)

- Sinking fund provisions provide for the repayment of principal through a series of payments over the life of the issue.
    - 감채기금
    - 주로 amortizing bond에 있음
    - Sinking fund provisions offer both advantages and disadvantages to bondholders.
        - On the plus side, bonds with a sinking fund provision have less credit risk because the periodic redemptions reduce the total amount of principal to be repaid at maturity. The presence of a sinking fund, however, can be a disadvantage to bondholders when interest rates fall.
        - This disadvantage to bondholders can be seen by considering the case where interest rates have fallen since bond issuance, so the bonds are trading at a price above the sinking funds redemption price.
        - This means the bonds have more reinvestment risk because bondholders who have their bonds redeemed can only reinvest the funds at the new, lower yield (assuming they buy bonds of similar risk).

![./Untitled%2037.png](./Untitled%2037.png)

- In the case of a bond with a sinking fund, the greater probability of receiving the principal repayment prior to maturity increases the expected cash flows during the bond's life and, therefore, the uncertainty about interest income on reinvested funds.
- Reinvestment risk
    - interim cashflow over the life of the bond
        - 채권 만기까지 현금흐름이 있을 때
        - 이 중간 현금은 전부 재투자 위험에 노출
        - Zero coupon bond는 재투자 위험이 없음
    - Interest rate가 떨어질 때
        - 재투자 수익 감소를 의미
    - 이 구 조건이 모두 성립해야 재투자 위험이 발생함

### Floating-Rate Notes

![./Untitled%2038.png](./Untitled%2038.png)

- 변동금리채권
    - floating-rate notes (FRN) or floaters
    - The market rate of interest is called the reference rate, and an FRN promises to pay the reference rate plus some interest margin. This added margin is typically expressed in basis points.

![./Untitled%2039.png](./Untitled%2039.png)

- A floating-rate note may have a cap, which benefits the issuer by placing a limit on how high the coupon rate can rise.
- Often, FRNs with caps also have a floor, which benefits the bondholder by placing a minimum on the coupon rate (regardless of how low the reference rate falls).

![./Untitled%2040.png](./Untitled%2040.png)

- An inverse floater has a coupon rate that increases when the reference rate decreases and decreases when the reference rate increases.

### Step-up coupon bonds

![./Untitled%2041.png](./Untitled%2041.png)

- The coupon rate increases over time according to a predetermined schedule. Typically, step-up coupon bonds have a call feature that allows the firm to redeem the bond issue at a set price at each step-up date.
- We can view step-up coupon bonds as having some protection against increases in market interest rates to the extent they are offset by increases in bond coupon rates.

### Credit-linked coupon bond

- 신용위험에 연동되서 coupon이 변하는 채권
- A credit-linked coupon bond carries a provision stating that the coupon rate will go up by a certain amount if the credit rating of the issuer falls and go down if the credit rating of the issuer improves.
- 투자자에게 좋은 점
    - 신용상태와 연동 → 가격하락 방어

### Payment-in-kind (PIK) bond

![./Untitled%2042.png](./Untitled%2042.png)

- 쿠폰을 채권으로 받는 채권
- A payment-in-kind (PIK) bond allows the issuer to make the coupon payments by increasing the principal amount of the outstanding bonds, essentially paying bond interest with more bonds.
- Firms that issue PIK bonds typically do so because they anticipate that firm cash flows may be less than required to service the debt, often because of high levels of debt financing (leverage).
- These bonds typically have higher yields because of a lower perceived credit quality from cash flow shortfalls of simply because of the high leverage of the issuing firm.

### Deferred coupon bond

- split coupon bond
- regular coupon payments do not begin until a period of time after issuance.
- 일정 기간 이후부터 쿠폰을 주는 채권
- 거치채권

### Index-linked bond

![./Untitled%2043.png](./Untitled%2043.png)

- Inflation-linked bonds
- Capital-indexed bonds
    - This is the most common structure.
    - TIPS (U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities)
- coupon rate는 실효 이자율
- 인플레이션이 변동할 때마다 원금을 adjust해서 이자를 산정
- 만기때는 최소 액면가액 보장, 최대 인플레이션 보정 par value 보장

# Callable Bond

- 채권 + call option
- 채권의 발행자가 채권을 상환할 수 있는 call option을 갖는 것
    - 채권자로부터 채권을 되사올 수 있는 권리를 갖는 것

![./Untitled%2044.png](./Untitled%2044.png)

- 보통 callable bond는 Bermuda style로 발행됨
    - 만기까지의 여러 기간 중에 다양한 striking price로 call option을 행사할 수 있는 채권
- callable bond는 reinvestment risk가 올라감
    - interest rate가 내려가는 상황이면 더 크게 올라감

![./Untitled%2045.png](./Untitled%2045.png)

- callable bond price = straight bond price - call option value
    - underlying asset: callable bond
- callable bond yield = straight bond yield + call premium
    - callable bond는 straight bond보다 쌈
- call striking price가 고정되어 있으면 fixed price call provision이라고 부름
- issuer가 call option을 행사하는 경우는 시장 금리가 내려갈 때
    - 자본조달비용이 떨어졌기 때문에 비싼 이자를 지급해야 하는 채권은 상환하고, 싸게 발행하는 대출로 갈아타려고
    - 또는 회사의 신용도가 개선된 경우

## 3 styles of exercise

- American style - first call date 이래로 언제든 call 행사 가능
- European style - 정해진 call date에만 call 행사 가능
- Bermuda style - first call date 이래로 정해진 날마다 다양한 call 가격으로 call 행사 가능

## Make-whole call provision

- call price = max(market value, par + 경과이자)의 조건으로 발행된 callable bond
- 거의 해당 call을 선언하는 경우는 없지만, 발행 목적은 hostile takeover 가능성이 있을 때 방어 수단으로 사용됨

## Contingency provision

- 우발조항, 조건부 조항
    - 일정 조건이 만족되지 않으면 발생하지 않는 조항
- bond indenture는 계약조항 전체를 의미하고
    - 각 조항들을 covenant나 provision이라고 부름
- contingency provision은 embedded option이라고도 하는데, 이는 이미 채권의 일부로서 채권과 분리될 수 없음을 의미함

# Putable bond

- 채권자가 채권을 사달라고 할 수 있는 put option을 소유하는 채권
- putable bond price = straight bond price + put option value
- putable bond yield = straight bond price - put option premium

# Convertible bond(전환사채)

![./Untitled%2046.png](./Untitled%2046.png)

- convertible bond price = straight bond price + conversion option value
- convertible bond yield = straight bond yield - conversion option premium
- lockout period 이후 신규 발행되는 주식으로 전환할 수 있는 conversion option이 붙은 채권
- Conversion price: 전환가격
- Conversion ratio: 전환률
- Conversion value = 전환률 * 주가
    - 주가 > conversion price인 경우 전환 요청

# Warrant

- Bond with warrant (BW): 신주인수권부사채
- BW price = straight bond price + call option on new stocks
    - call option만 분리가능
    - call을 행사해도 채권은 존속
    - stock은 신주발행

![./Untitled%2047.png](./Untitled%2047.png)

# Contingent Convertible Bond(CoCo bond)

- 우발적 상황이 생겼을 때 바로 전환되는 채권

![./Untitled%2048.png](./Untitled%2048.png)

- 예를 들어 은행에서 BIS 비율 밑으로 자기자본이 떨어지는 event가 발생하면 contingent convertible bond는 자동으로 주식으로 전환되어 자기자본을 채우는 역할을 함

- The relationships between price and yield as follows:
    - At a point in time, a decrease (increase) in a bond's YTM will increase (decrease) its price.
    - If a bond's coupon rate is greater than its YTM, its price will be at a premium to par value. If a bond's coupon rate is less than its YTM, its price will be at a discount to par value.
    - The percentage decrease in value when the YTM increases by a given amount is smaller than the increase in value when the YTM decreases by the same amount (the price-yield relationship is convex).
    - Other things equal, the price of bond with a lower coupon rate is more sensitive to a change in yield than is the price of a bond with a higher coupon rate.
        - coupon effect
    - Other things equal, the price of a bond with a longer maturity is more sensitive to a change in yield than is the price of a bond with a shorter maturity.
        - maturity effect

## Yield measure

> 44.f. Calculate annual yield on a bond for varying compounding periods in a year.
> 

> 44.g. Calculate and interpret yield measures for fixed-rate bonds and floating-rate notes.
> 

![./Untitled%2071.png](./Untitled%2071.png)

- It may be necessary to adjust the quoted yield on a bond to make it comparable with the yield on a bond with a different periodicity.
- current yield = annual cash coupon payment / bond price
- A bond's simple yield takes a discount or premium into account by assuming that any discount or premium declines evenly over the remaining years to maturity.

![./Untitled%2072.png](./Untitled%2072.png)

![./Untitled%2073.png](./Untitled%2073.png)

- The option-adjusted yield is calculated by adding the value of the call option to the bond's current flat price. The value of a callable bond is equal to the value of the bond if it did not have the call option, minus the value of the call option (because the issuer owns the call option).
- The option-adjusted yield will be less than the yield-to-maturity for a callable bond because callable bonds have higher yield to compensate bondholders for the issuer's call option. The option-adjusted yield can be used to compare the yields of bonds with various embedded options to each other and to similar option-free bond.

![./Untitled%2075.png](./Untitled%2075.png)

- yield curve에는 3종류가 있음
    - spot rate yield curve
    - forward rate curve
    - YTM curve

### Spot rate yield curve

- 해당 만기의 ZCB를 현재가치로 할인하는 연 평균 discount rate인 spot rate를 만기에 따라 그린 yield curve
- The spot rate yield curve (spot curve) for U.S Treasury bonds is also referred to as the zero curve (for zero-coupon) or strip curve (because zero-coupon U.S. Treasury bonds are also called stripped Treasuries).

### YTM yield curve

- A yield curve for coupon bonds shows the YTMs for coupon bonds at various maturities.
- A par bond yield curve, or par curve, is not calculated from yields on actual bonds but constructed from the spot curve.
- YTM은 coupon bond를 할인하는 단 하나의 연 평균 discount rate
- YTM curve는 coupon의 재투자 noise를 포함하고 있기 때문에, term structure of interest를 나타내는 것이 아니라 coupon bond의 연 평균 수익률을 나타내는 curve
- IRR의 개념

### Forward rate curve

![./Untitled%2076.png](./Untitled%2076.png)

![./Untitled%2077.png](./Untitled%2077.png)

- 단위기간 금리를 말함
- 연 평균 개념이 아니고, 1f1 = 1 year forward rate 1 year from now
- Forward rates are yields for future periods. The rate of interest on 1-year loan that would be mad two years from now is a forward rate. A forward yield curve shows the future rates for bonds or money market securities for the same maturities for annual periods in the future.

> 44.j. Define forward rates and calculate spot rates from forward rates, forward rates from spot rates, and the price of a bond using forward rates.
> 
- A forward rate is a borrowing/lending rate for a loan to be made at some future date.
- The idea here is that borrowing for three years at the 3-year spot rates, or borrowing for one-year periods in three successive years, should have the same cost.

## Yield Spread

> 44.k. Compare, calculate, and interpret yield spread measures.
> 

![./Untitled%2078.png](./Untitled%2078.png)

- A yield spread is the difference between the yields of two different bonds. Yield spread are typically quoted in basis points.
- yield spread는 별 달리 말이 없으면 YTM spread를 말함
- 회사채의 yield spread에는 macroeconomic factor인 무위험 이자율과 firm-specific factor인 스프레드가 포함되어 있음
- 회사채의 YTM 변화는 macroeconomic factor만 변하거나, firm-specific factor만 변하거나, 둘 다 변하거나 해서 발생한다.
- Yield spreads are useful for analyzing the factors that affect a bond's yield.
    - all bond yields (macroeconomic factors) or by firm-specific or industry-specific (microeconomic) factors

### G-spread

- A yield spread over a government bond is also known as a G-spread
- 위에서 말한 국채 - 정부채 간의 yield spread를 G-spread라고 한다.
- benchmark spread라고 하기도 함

### Interpolated spread (I-spread)

- An alternative to using government bond yields as benchmarks is to use rates for interest rate swaps in the same currency and with the same tenor as bond. Yield spreads relative to swap rates are known as interpolated spreads or I-spreads.
- 비교할 벤치마크 본드가 없어서 swap rate를 사용하여 계산한 스프레드를 I-spread라고 함

### Zero-Volatility and Option-Adjusted Spreads

![./Untitled%2079.png](./Untitled%2079.png)

![./Untitled%2080.png](./Untitled%2080.png)

- A disadvantage of G-spreads and I-spreads is that they are theoretically correct only if the spot yield curve is flat so that yields are approximately the same across maturities. Normally, however, the spot yield curve is upward-sloping.
- G-spreads랑 I-spreads는 YTM을 비교하는데, 이는 YTM = spot rate이어야 한다는 가정이 숨어있다.
    - 기본적으로 YTM은 해당 만기의 coupon bond의 연 평균 수익률이 전 구간에 다 똑같이 적용되는데, spot rate는 이런 coupon bond를 기간별로 쪼개기 때문에 기간이 길면 길수록 spot rate가 높은 특성이 있다.
    - 이러한 이유로 인해 G-spreads와 I-spreads는 대략적으로 계산할 수 있긴 하나, 비현실적인 가정을 깔고 있다.
- Z-spread는 국채 spot rate yield curve를 얼마나 들어올려야 회사채 spot rate yield curve가 되는지에 대한 수치이다.
- 회사채(option-free bond)는 기본적으로 국채 spot rate에 spread를 더해서 spot rate를 계산한다.
    - 이 스프레드를 Z-spread라고 부르며, 이 spread에는 default risk, liquidity risk가 포함되어 있다.
- Callable bond로 넘어오면, Z-spread에 call risk premium이 추가되면서 callable bond는 otherwise identical, 일반 straight bond보다 싸다.
    - 그리고 이 callable bond price + call option value를 해서 계산하는데 사용된 spread를 Option-Adjusted Spread라고 한다.
    - 이론적으로 이 계산법은 callable bond price에서 option의 가치를 제거해줬으므로 같은 조건의 straight bond의 Z-spread와 option-adjusted spread는 같아야 한다.
- Straight bond z-spread < callable bond z-spread
- callable bond z-spread > callable bond option-adjusted spread
    - 이 둘의 차이가 call risk premium, call option value이다.
- An option-adjusted spread (OAS) is used for bonds with embedded options.
- Loosely speaking, the option-adjusted spread takes the option yield component out of the Z-spread measure; the OAS is the spread to government spot rate curve that the bond would have if it were option-free.
- If we calculate an OAS for a callable bond, it will be less than the bond's Z-spread. The difference is the extra yield required to compensate bondholders for the call option. That exra yield is the option value.
    - option value = Z-spread - OAS
    - OAS = Z-spread - option value

## Sources of returns, duration

> 46.a. Calculate and interpret the sources of return from investing in a fixed-rate bond.
> 

![./Untitled%2081.png](./Untitled%2081.png)

- spot rate는 금리구조의 개념, YTM은 연평균 수익률의 개념
- 보통 spot rate로 계산 된 price를 가지고 YTM을 역산한다.
- YTM은 시장에서 계속 변하는 변수이므로 interest risk를 반영하는데, 이는 채권의 price risk와 같다.

### Three sources of returns

1. Coupon and principal payments.
2. Interest earned on coupon payments that are reinvested over the investor's holding period for the bond.
3. Any capital gain or loss if the bond is sold prior to maturity.

### Assumption

- We will assume that a bond makes all of its promised coupon and principal payments on time.
- Additionally, we assume that the interest rate earned on reinvested coupon payments is the same as the YTM on the bond.
- Given the assumptions just listed:
    1. An investor who holds a fixed-rate bond to maturity will earn an annualized rate of return equal to the YTM of the bond when purchased.
    2. An investor who sells a bond prior to maturity will earn a rate of return equal to the YTM at purchase if the YTM at sale has not changed since purchase.
    3. If the market YTM for the bond, our assumed reinvestment rate, increases (decreases) after the bond is purchased but before the first coupon date, a buy-and-hold investor's realized return will be higher (lower) than the YTM of the bond when purchased.
    4. If the market YTM for the bond, our assumed reinvestment rate, increases after the bond is purchased but before the first coupon date, a bond investor will earn a rate of return that is lower than the YTM at bond purchased if the bond is held for a short period.
    5. If the market YTM for the bond, our assumed reinvestment rate, decreases after the bond is purchased but before the first coupon date, a bond investor will earn a rate of return that is lower than the YTM at bond purchase if the bond is held for a long period.
- A bond investor's annualized holding period rate of return is calculated as the compound annual return earned from the bond over the investor's holding period.

### Carrying Value

![./Untitled%2082.png](./Untitled%2082.png)

- YTM을 유지하면서 만기까지 변하는 가격
- 그냥 시간이 지나면서 자연스럽게 채권가격이 par value로 수렴하는데, 이 때의 가격을 이야기 함
- capital gain or loss가 발생하려면 매입 YTM과 매도 YTM이 달라야 함
    - 다르지 않다면 realized return rate = 매입 YTM

### Market price risk, reinvestment risk

![./Untitled%2083.png](./Untitled%2083.png)

![./Untitled%2084.png](./Untitled%2084.png)

- market price risk - the uncertainty about price due to uncertainty about market YTM)
- reinvestment risk - uncertainty about the total of coupon payments and reinvestment income on those payments due to the uncertainty about future reinvestment rates

### To summarize:

- short investment horizon: market price risk > reinvestment risk
- long investment horizon: market price risk < reinvestment risk

## Duration

> 46.b. Define, calculate, and interpret Macaulay, modified, and effective durations.
> 

### Macaulay Duration

![./Untitled%2085.png](./Untitled%2085.png)

- Duration이라고 하면 보통 이 Macaulay duration을 말함
- 채권 현금흐름의 현재가치의 가중평균 만기이다.
    - 소위 무게중심
- duration은 채권가격의 민감도를 나타낸다.

</aside>

### Modified Duration

![./Untitled%2086.png](./Untitled%2086.png)

- MD라고 하면 Modified duration을 말함
- duration에 (1+YTM)을 할인해서 나온 값을 의미함
- YTM 변화에 따른 채권 가격의 변화율을 선형적으로 나타냄
- 1% YTM 변화에 따른 채권 가격 변화를 대략적으로 알 수 있음
    - short term일 때 유리하며, long term으로 가면 오차가 커짐

### Approximate Modified Duration

![./Untitled%2087.png](./Untitled%2087.png)

- 위 MD는 상승, 하락마다 수치가 다른데, 이를 그냥 평균내서 만든게 바로 AMD이다.

### Effective Duration

- YTM의 변화에는 risk free rate yield 변화와 Z-spread 변화가 같이 포함되어 있는데, 이 중에서 risk free rate yield 변화로 인한 채권가격 민감도만을 계산하는 것이 effective duration이다.
- MD와는 다르게 long term으로 사용해도 괜찮다.
- The pricing of bonds with embedded put, call, or prepayment options begins with the benchmark yield curve, not simply the current YTM of the bond. The appropriate measure of interest rate sensitivity for these bonds is effective duration.

> 46.c. Explain why effective duration is the most appropriate measure of interest rate risk for bonds with embedded options.
> 

![./Untitled%2088.png](./Untitled%2088.png)

![./Untitled%2089.png](./Untitled%2089.png)

- For bonds with embedded options, the future cash flows depends not only on future interest rates but also on the path that interest rates take over time (did they fall to a new deal or rise to that level?).
- The effective duration measure must also be based on bond prices form a pricing model. The fact that bonds with embedded options have uncertain future cash flows means that our present value calculations for bond value based on YTM cannot be used.

### Key rate duration

![./Untitled%2090.png](./Untitled%2090.png)

![./Untitled%2091.png](./Untitled%2091.png)

- duration은 yield curve의 parallel
- partial duration이라고도 한다.
- A key duration, also known as a partial duration, is defined as the sensitivity of the value of a bond or portfolio to changes in the spot rate for a specific maturity, holding other spot rates constant. A bond or portfolio will have a key rate duration for each maturity range on the spot rate curve.
- We can use the key rate duration for each maturity to compute the effect on the portfolio of the interest rate change at that maturity. The effect on the overall portfolio is the sum of these individual effects.

> 46.e. Explain how a bond's maturity, coupon, and yield level affects its interest rate risk.
> 

![./Untitled%2092.png](./Untitled%2092.png)

1. Other things equal, an increase in a bond's maturity will (usually) increase its interest rate risk.
    - maturity effect
2. Other things equal, an increase in the coupon rate of a bond will decrease its interest rate risk.
    - coupon effect
3. Other things equal, an increase (decrease) in a bond's YTM will decrease (increase) its interest rate risk.
    - yield level effect
4. Adding either a put or a call provision will decrease a straight bond's interest rate risk as measured by effective duration.
    - callable bond는 상한이 있어서 effective duration이 낮아짐
    - putable bond는 하한이 있어서 effective duration이 낮아짐

> 46.f. Calculate the duration of a portfolio and explain the limitations of portfolio duration.
> 

![./Untitled%2093.png](./Untitled%2093.png)

- 포트폴리오의 duration을 추정하는 접근법에는 2가지가 있음
    - 하나는 각 기간별 현금흐름의 현재가치 가중평균 방법
    - 나머지 하나는 개별 채권 duration의 가중평균 방법
        - 이 방법은 yield curve의 parallel shift를 전제로 하고 있음
- The first approach is theoretically correct but not often used in practice. The yield measure for calculating portfolio duration with this approach is the cash flow yield, the IRR of the bond portfolio. This is inconsistent with duration capturing the relationship between YTM and price.
- The second approach is typically used in practice. Using the durations of individual portfolio bonds makes its possible to calculate the duration for a portfolio that contains bonds with embedded options by using their effective durations.

> 46.g. Calculate and interpret the money duration of a bond and price value of a basis point (PVBP).
> 

![./Untitled%2094.png](./Untitled%2094.png)

- Money duration은 단순히 MD에 가격을 곱해준 것
- PVBP는 1 basis point가 변할 때 가격의 변화량을 의미한다.

> 46.h. Calculate and interpret approximately convexity and distinguish between approximate and effective convexity.
> 

![./Untitled%2095.png](./Untitled%2095.png)

![./Untitled%2096.png](./Untitled%2096.png)

![./Untitled%2097.png](./Untitled%2097.png)

- 채권의 price-yield curve는 곡선이다. 그렇기 때문에 곡률인 convexity가 있는데, linear approximation이었던 MD를 이 convexity로 보정할 수 있다.
- MD로 추정한 값과 실제 price-yield curve의 차이를 convexity adjustment라고 한다.
- Convexity is a measure of the curvature of the price-yield relation. The more curved it is, the greater the convexity adjustment to a duration-based estimate of the change in price for a given change in YTM.
- A bond's convexity is increased or decreased by the same bond characteristics that affect duration. A longer maturity, a lower coupon rate, or a lower yield to maturity will all increase convexity, and vice versa.

![./Untitled%2098.png](./Untitled%2098.png)

- While the convexity of any option-free bond is positive, the convexity of a callable bond can be negative at low yields.

> 46.i. Estimate the percentage price change of a bond for a specified change in yield, given the bond's approximate duration and convexity.

- a bond's duration - first-order effect
- convexity - second-order effect

> 46.j. Describe how the term structure of yield volatility affects the interest rate risk of a bond.
> 

![./Untitled%20100.png](./Untitled%20100.png)

- The term structure of yield volatility refers to the relation between the volatility of bond yields and their times to maturity.
- It could be the case that a shorter-term bond has more price volatility than a longer-term bond with a greater duration because of the greater volatility of the shorter-term yield.

> 46.k. Describe the relationships among a bond's holding period return, its duration, and the investment horizon.
> 

![./Untitled%20101.png](./Untitled%20101.png)

- duration보다 짧게 보유하면 positive duration gap
- duration보다 길게 보유하면 negative duration gap
- duration은 investment horizon에 이용할 수 있는데, 채권 매입 당시 YTM을 달성하려면 duration 기간 동안 투자 후 매각하면 정확히 매입 YTM을 달성할 수 있다.

> 46.l. Explain how changes in credit spread and liquidity affect yield-to-maturity of a bond and how duration and convexity can be used to estimate the price effect of the changes.
> 
- The benchmark yield curve's interest rates have two components; the real rate of return and expected inflation.
- A bond's spread to the benchmark curve also has two components, a premium for credit risk and a premium for lac of liquidity relative to the benchmark securities.
- Because we are treating the yields associated with each component as additive, a given increase or decrease in any of those components of yield will increase or decrease the bond's YTM by the same amount.

> 47.a. Describe credit risk and credit-related risks affecting corporate bonds.
> 

> 47.b. Describe default probability and loss severity as components of credit risk.
> 

![./Untitled%20103.png](./Untitled%20103.png)

![./Untitled%20104.png](./Untitled%20104.png)

- Credit risk is the risk associated with losses stemming from the failure of a borrower to make timely and full payments of interest or principal.

### Default risk

- the probability that a borrower (bond issuer) fails to pay interest or repay principal when due.
- default probability

### Loss severity

- the value a bond investor will lose if the issuer defaults.
- Loss severity can be stated as a monetary amount or as a percentage of a bond's value (principal and unpaid interest).
- Loss given default

### Expected loss

- expected loss = default probability * loss given default

### recovery rate

- loss given default = 1 - default recovery rate
- The recovery rate is the percentage of a bond's value an investor will receive if the issuer defaults.

### Yield spread

- The difference in yield between a credit-risky bond and a credit-risk-free bond of similar maturity is called its yield spread.
- Bond prices are inversely related to spread; a wider spread implies a lower bond price and a narrower spread implies a higher price. The size of the spread reflects the creditworthiness of the issuer and the liquidity of the market for its bonds.

### Spread risk

- the possibility that a bond's spread will widen due to one or both of these factors.
- Credit migration risk or downgrade risk
    - 등급하락위험
    - the possibility that spreads will increase because the issuer has become less creditworthy.
- Market liquidity risk
    - the risk of receiving less than market value when selling a bond and is reflected in the size of the bid-ask spread.

> 47.c. Describe seniority rankings of corporate debt and explain the potential violation of the priority of claims in a bankruptcy proceeding.
> 
- Each category of debt from the same issuer is ranked according to a priority of claims in the event of a default.

### Seniority ranking

- 선순위구조
- A bond's priority of claims to the issuer's assets and cash flows is referred to as its seniority ranking.
- All debt within the same category is said to the pari passu, or have same priority of claims.
- Recovery rates are higher for debt with the highest priority of claims and decrease with each lower rank of seniority.
- The lower the seniority ranking of a bond, the higher its credit risk. Investors require a higher yield to accept a lower seniority ranking.

### Secured / unsecured debt

- Secured debt is backed by collateral, while unsecured debt or debentures represent a general claim to the issuer's assets and cash flows.
- Secured debt has higher priority of claims than unsecured debt.

> 47.d. Distinguish between corporate issuer credit rating and issue credit ratings and describe the rating agency practice of "notching."
> 

![./Untitled%20105.png](./Untitled%20105.png)

- Issuer credit ratings are called corporate family ratings (CFR)
    - issuer-specific rating
    - 발행자 등급
- issue-specific ratings are called corporate credit ratings (CCR)
    - 발행물 등급

### Cross default provision

- 교차채무불이행
- 다른 채권이 default나면, 해당 채권도 default라는 조항

### Notching

- The assignment of individual issue ratings that are higher or lower than that of the issuer is referred to as notching.
- 해당 발행자가 발행한 채권들 중에서 priority에 따라 부여하는 +, zero, -
- Notching is less common for highly-rated issuers than for lower-rated issuers.
- For firms with higher probabilities of default (lower ratings), differences in expected recovery rates among a firm's bonds are more significant. For this reason, notching is more likely for issues with lower creditworthiness in general.

### Structural subordination

- 구조적 후순위
- 지주사 구조에서 주로 나타나는 현상
- In holding company structure, both the parent company and the subsidiaries may have outstanding debt.
- 자회사의 현금 흐름이 자회사 발행 채권의 이자를 먼저 지불하고 나서 지주사로 넘어와서 지주사 채권의 이자를 지불하는 구조이기 때문에 발생
- 지주사 채권을 structural subordinate라고 한다.

> 47.e. Explain risks in relying on ratings from credit rating agencies.
> 
- Credit ratings are dynamic
- Rating agencies are not perfect
- Event risk is difficult to assess
- Credit ratings lag market pricing
    - Market prices and credit spreads can change mush faster than credit ratings. Additionally, two bonds with the same rating can trade at different yields. Market prices reflects expected losses, while credit ratings only assess default risk.

> 47.f. Explain the four Cs (Capacity, Collateral, Covenants, and Character) of traditional credit analysis.
> 

## Capacity

- capacity = ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet financial obligation

### Industry structure

- The first level of a credit analyst's assessment is industry structure. Industry structure can be described by Porter's five forces: threat of entry, power of suppliers, power of buyers, threat of substitution, and rivalry among existing competitors.

### Industry fundamentals

- Industry cyclicality
- Industry growth prospects
- Industry published statistics

### Company fundamentals

- Competitive position
- Operating history
- Management's strategy and execution
- Ratios and ratio analysis

## Collateral

- Collateral analysis is more important for less creditworthy companies.
- Intangible assets
    - Patents are considered high-quality intangible assets because they can be more easily sold to generate cash flows than other intangibles.
    - Goodwill is not considered a high-quality intangible asset and is usually written down when company performance is poor.
- Depreciation
    - High depreciation expense relative to capital expenditures may signal that management is not investing sufficiently in the company. The quality of the company's assets may be poor, which may lead to reduced operating cash flow and potentially high loss severity.
- Equity market capitalization
    - A stock that trades below book value may indicate that company assets are of low quality.
- Human and intellectual capital
    - These are difficult to value, but a company may have intellectual property that can function as collateral.

## Covenants

- Covenants are the terms and conditions the borrowers and lenders agree to as part of a bond issue.

### Affirmative covenants

- Affirmative covenants require the borrower to take certain actions, such as using the proceeds for the for the stated purpose; paying interest; principal, and taxes; carrying insurance on pledged assets; continuing in its current business activity; and following relevant laws and regulations.
- 채무자가 해야 하는 조항들

### Negative covenants

- 채무자가 하면 안되는 조항들

## Character

- Characters refers to management's integrity and its commitment to repay the loan.
- 경영자의 전략, 실행
- track record
- accounting policies and tax strategies
- fraud and malfeasance record
- prior treatment of bondholders

> 

![./Untitled%20106.png](./Untitled%20106.png)

- ratings agencies publish benchmark values for financial ratios that are associated with each ratings classification.

### Profits and cash flows

- EBITDA
    - A drawback of using this measure for credit analysis is that is does not adjust for capital expenditures and changes in working capital, which are necessary uses of funds for a going concern.
- Funds from operations
- Free cash flow before dividends
- Free cash flow after dividends

### Leverage ratios

- Debt / capital
- Debt / EBITDA
- FFO / debt
- FCF after dividends / debt

### Coverage ratios

- EBITDA / interest expense
- EBIT / interest expense

- economic conditions
- financial market performance
- broker-dealer capital
- general market demand and supply

> 47.j. Explain special considerations when evaluating the credit of high yield, sovereign, and non-sovereign government debt issuers and issue.
> 

## High yield debt

- noninvestment grade corporate bonds
- junk bonds
- Liquidity or availability of cash if critical for high yield issuers. high yield issuers have limited access to additional borrowings, and available funds tend to be more expensive for high yield issuers.

### 6 sources

- Balance sheet cash
- Working capital
- Operating cash flow (CFO)
- Bank credit
- Equity issued
- Sales of assets

### Financial projections

- Projecting future earnings and cash flows, including stress scenarios and accounting for changes in capital expenditures and working capital are important for revealing potential vulnerabilities to the inability to meet debt payments.

### Debt structure

- High yield issuers' capital structures often include different types of debt with several levels of seniority and hence varying levels of potential loss.
- High yield companies for which secured bank debt is a high proportion of the capital structure are said to be top heavy and have less capacity to borrow from banks in financially stressful periods.

### Corporate structure

- Many high-yield companies use a holding company structure.

### Covenants

- Change of control put
    - This covenant gives debt holders the right to require the issuer to buy back debt (typically for par value or a value slightly above par) in the event of an acquisition.
    - 경영진이 바뀌면 채권 회수를 요구할 수 있는 권한
    - 채권투자자 보호 목적
- restricted payments
- limitations on liens
    - The covenant limits the amount of secured debt that a borrower can carry. Unsecured debt holders prefer the issuer to have less secured debt, which increases the recovery amount available to them in the event of default.
- Restricted versus unrestricted subsidiaries
    - Restricted subsidiaries' cash flows and assets can be used to service the debt of the parent holding company. This benefits creditors of holding companies because their debt is pari passu with the debt of restricted subsidiaries, rather than structurally subordinated.

### Enterprise Value

- High yield analysis can include some of the same techniques as equity market analysis, such as enterprise value. EV is equity market capitalization plus total debt minus excess cash.

## Sovereign debt

- 국채
- basic framework for evaluating and assigning a credit rating to sovereign debt includes five key areas
    - Institutional assessment
    - Economic assessment
    - External assessment
    - Fiscal assessment
    - monetary assessment
- Credit rating agencies assign each national government two ratings
    - a local currency debt rating
    - a foreign currency debt rating

## Non-Sovereign government bonds

- Municipal bonds
- General obligation (GO) bonds are unsecured bonds backed by the full faith credit of the issuing government entity, which is to say they are supported by its taxing power.
- Revenue bonds are issued to finance specific projects, such as airports, toll bridges, hospitals, and power generation facilities.
- Revenue bonds often have higher credit risk than GO bonds because the project is the sole source of funds to service the debt.

# ABS

> 45.a. Explain benefits of securitization for economics and financial markets.> 45.b. Describe securitization, including the parties involved in the process and the roles they play.
> 45.c. Describe typical structures of securitization, including credit tranching and time tranching.
> 

![./Untitled%20107.png](./Untitled%20107.png)

![./Untitled%20108.png](./Untitled%20108.png)

- Securitization refers to a process by which financial assets are purchased by an entity that then issues securities supported by the cash flows from those financial assets.
- The primary benefits of the securitization of financial assets are (1) a reduction in funding costs for firms selling the financial assets to the securitizing entity and (2) an increase in the liquidity of the underlying financial assets.
- Compared to this traditional structure, with the bank serving the function of financial intermediary between borrowers and lenders, securitization can provide the following benefits:
    - Securitization reduces intermediation costs, which results in lower funding costs for borrowers and higher risk-adjusted returns for lenders (investors).
    - With securitization, the investors' legal claim to the mortgages or other loans is stronger than it is with only a general claim against the bank's overall assets.
    - When a bank securitizes its loans, the securities are actively traded, which increases the liquidity of the bank's assets compared to holding the loans.
    - By securitizing loans, banks are able to lend more than if they could only fund loans with bank assets. When a loan portfolio is securitized, the bank receives the proceeds, which can then be used to make more loans.
    - Securitization has led to financial innovation that allows investors to invest in securities that better match their preferred risk, maturity, and return characteristics.
    - Securitization provides diversification and risk reduction compared to purchasing individual loans (whole loans).

> 45.d. Describe types and characteristics of residential mortgage loans that are typically securitized.
> 
- A residential mortgage loan is a loan for which the collateral that underlies that loan is residential real estate.
- One key characteristic of a mortgage loan is its loan-to-value ratio (LTV), the percentage of the value of the collateral real estate that is loaned to the borrower. The lower the LTV, the higher the borrower's equity in the property.
- RMBS - Residential MBS
- CMBS - Commercial MBS

## Prepayment provisions

- A partial or full repayment of principal in excess of the scheduled principal repayments required by the mortgage is referred to as a prepayment.
- 보통 집을 팔거나, refinance할 때 발생
- prepayment penalty가 있음

## Foreclosure

- 압류, 저당권 행사
- nonrecourse loans
    - 대출이 부도나고, 압류를 행사했을 때, 저당잡힌 자산의 가치가 전체 대출의 가치보다 낮아도 채무자에게 추가로 대출에 대한 상환 요구를 할 수 없는 대출
- recourse loan

> 45.f. Define prepayment risk and describe the prepayment risk of mortgage-backed securities.
> 
- Any mortgage included in the pool is referred to as a securitized mortgage.
- The weighted average maturity (WAM) of the pool is equal to the weighted average of the final maturities of all the mortgages in the pool, weighted by each mortgage's outstanding principal balance as a proportion of the total outstanding principal value of all the mortgages in the pool.
- The weighted average coupon (WAC) of the pool is the weighted average of the interest rates of all the mortgages in the pool.

## Agency RMBS

- Agency RMBS are issued by the Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac
- government-sponsored enterprises (GSE)
- mortgage pass-through securities
- Agency RMBS의 pool mortgage가 되려면, 조건이 까다로움
- pass-through mortgage는 수수료를 떼고 pass-through rates만큼 받음

## Prepayment risk

![./Untitled%20109.png](./Untitled%20109.png)

- pass-through securities에서 중요한 것은 prepayment risk
- scheduled 분할상환원금, 이자는 prepayment가 아님
- unscheduled cashflow가 너무 일찍 들어오면 prepayment risk
    - too late or never = default
    - insurance로 cover
- prepayment가 너무 크면 - contraction risk
- prepayment가 너무 작으면 - extension risk
- single monthly mortality rate = prepayment / scheduled cashflow
    - The SMM is the percentage by which prepayments reduce the month-end principal balance, compared to what it would have been with  only scheduled principal payments (with no prepayments).
- The conditional prepayment rate (CPR) is an annualized measure of prepayments.
    - 예상 prepayment를 연율화해서 그려놓은 것
    - benchmark는 PSA 100을 사용하고, 각자 생각하는 prepayment rate에 따라 정도를 조절해서 사용함.

## Prepayment risk

![./Untitled%20110.png](./Untitled%20110.png)

![./Untitled%20111.png](./Untitled%20111.png)

## CMO

- Collateralized Mortgage Obligations are securitized that are collateralized by RMBS.
- 각각의 CMO tranche는 조기상환 리스크에 대한 익스포져가 다르다.
    - total prepayment risk of the underlying RMBS is not changed.
    - 그냥 트랜치 내에서 reapportioned
- 기관 투자자들은 부채와 자산의 만기를 일치시키려는 목적이 있어서 기관마다 조기상환 리스크에 대한 tolerance가 다르다.
- CMO tranche들의 contraction, extension risk는 각각 다르다.
    - 기관 투자자들의 니즈에 맞게 customized되어 발행된다.

## Sequential CMO

- pass-through MBS에서 주로 있는 형태인데, 트랜치 상환 순서대로 원금이 상환되는 구조의 CMO이다.
- 2개의 트랜치가 있고, 두 트랜치는 모두 이자를 수취한다.
- 그러나 short tranche가 원금을 제일 먼저 다 상환 받고 나서야 long tranche가 원금을 상환받기 시작한다.

## Planned Amortization Class (PAC) CMO

- PAC tranche and support tranche로 구성
- PAC tranche는 일정 범위 내의 조기상환율이 유지되면 만기가 변하지 않고 일정하게 유지된다. 해당 조기상환 변동분은 전부 support tranche가 흡수한다.
- 만기가 변하지 않는 범위를 initial PAC collar라고 한다.
- 만기가 너무 크게 변해서 범위를 벗어난 PAC을 broken PAC이라고 부른다.
- support tranche는 아주 큰 contraction risk와 extension risk를 갖는다.
- When prepayment speeds fall and prepayments decreases, the support tranche average life is significantly longer than the average life of the PAC I tranche. Thus, the support tranche has significantly more extension risk.
- When prepayment speeds rise and prepayments increase, the support tranche average life is much shorter than that of the PAC I tranche. Thus, the support tranche also has significantly more contraction risk.
- Within the initial PAC collar of 100 to 300 PSA, the average life of the PAC I tranche is constant at 6.5 year.

## Nonagency MBS

![./Untitled%20112.png](./Untitled%20112.png)

- RMBS not issued by government are referred to as nongency RMBS.
- They are not guaranteed by the government, so credit risk an important consideration.
- To be investment grade, most nonagency RMBS include some sort of credit enhancement.
    - shifting interest mechanism = waterfall structure

> 45.g. Describe characteristics and risks of commercial mortgage-backed securities.
> 
- commercial MBS loans are repaid by real estate investors who, in turn, rely on tenants and customers to provide the cash flow to repay the mortgage loan.
- CMBS mortgages are structured as nonrecourse loans, meaning the lender can only look to the collateral as a means to repay a delinquent loan if the cash flows from the property are insufficient.
- For these reasons, the analysis of CMBS securities focuses on the credit risk of the property and not the credit risk of the borrower.
    - DEbt-to-service-coverage ratio (DSC) = net operating income / debt service
    - Loan-to-value ratio (LTV) = current mortgage amount / current appraised value
- At the end of the loan term, the loan will still have principal outstanding that needs to be paid; this amount is called a balloon payment.
    - 만기 때 큰 금액이 상환되지 않으면 예상보다 만기를 늘려줘야 하는 extension risk, ballon risk가 존재한다.

### Loan-level call protection

- 대출 단계에서 실행되는 call protection
- prepayment lockout
- defeasance
    - This is accomplished by using the prepaid principal to purchase a portfolio of government securities that is sufficient to make the remaining required payments on the CMBS.
- prepayment penalty points
- yield maintenance charges
    - This make whole charge is designed to make lenders indifferent to prepayment, as cash flows are equivalent (at current market rates) whether the loan is prepaid or not.

> 45.h. Describe types and characteristics of non-mortgage asset-backed securities, including the cash flows and risks of each type.
> 
- ABS backed by automobile loans and ABS backed by credit card receivables. These two have an important difference in that automobile loans are fully amortizing while credit card receivables are noamortizing.

## Auto Loan ABS

- The cash flow components of auto loan-backed securities include interest payments, scheduled principal payments, and prepayments.
- Automobile loan ABS all have some sort of credit enhancement to make them attractive to institutional investors.
    - reserve account, excess interest spread, overcollateralization

## Credit Card ABS

- The cash flow to a pool of credit card receivables includes finance charges, annual fees, and principal repayments.
- Credit cards have periodic payment schedules, but because their balances are revolving, the principal amount is maintained for a period of time. Interest on credit card ABS is paid periodically, but no principal is paid to the ABS holders during the lockout period, which may last from 18 months to 10 years after the ABS are created.
- If the underlying credit card holders make principal payments during the lockout period, these payments are sued to purchase additional credit card receivables, keeping the overall value of the receivables pool relatively constant.
    - 조기상환이 발생해도 새로운 credit card receivables를 구매해서 revolving 시키면서 이자를 지급함
