# Week 2

# History of computer

Abacus (주판)

- For arithmetic tasks, used in Babylonia as early as 2400 BC

Slide rule (계산자)

- For solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots, was developed in the late 16th century and found application in gunnery, surveying and navigation.

# Mind and intelligence

What is intelligence?

- I don’t either. Then, who is intelligent?

Mind-body problem

- How the human mind and body can causally interact

Kant: Philosophy of mind

- Sensibility, understanding, and reason

인간이 지성으로 내리는 판단을 대신 해주는 기계

- ex) 자동으로 체스를 두는 기계, 알파고

# Automata theory

The study of abstract machines and automata, as well as the computational problems that can be solved using them.

What can we do with the machine in the right figure?

A simple finite state machine for what?

- The automation starts in state S1, and transitions to the non-accepting state S2 upon reading the symbol 0.

The result?

- An automation that recognizes strings containing an even (or odd) number of 0s.

# Computation and automata

Theory of computation

- How efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm
- Automata theory
- Formal language theory
- Computability theory
- Computational complexity theory

Algorithm

- a process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.
