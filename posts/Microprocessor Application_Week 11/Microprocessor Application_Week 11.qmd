# Interrupts

What happens during interrupts

How to set them up

An important register - the flags register

# Why interrupts?

Interrupts force the current executing process to be preempted

- Without interrupts, a process could only be removed from the processor when it ended or voluntarily yielded

Interrupts allow timely processing of hardware events

Interrupts preclude the need for a (fast) CPU to poll on status of (slow) peripheral hardware

Primary interrupt use cases:

- Peripheral devices use interrupts to request CPU attention
- The timer interrupt controls the scheduling frequency of a system
- Processors use interrupts to communicate in multi-processor systems (e.g. for load balancing or synchronization)

# Interrupt vs. polling

Interruptible processor can do multiple jobs at a time
