# Black-Scholes Formula

The Black-Scholes formula is a limiting case of the binomial formula (infinitely many periods) for the price of a European option.

Consider an European call (or put) option written on a stock.

Assume that the stock pays dividend at the continuous rate $\delta$

## Call option price

$$
C(S, K, \sigma, r, T, \delta) = Se^{\delta T}N(d_1) - Ke^{-rT}N(d_2)
$$

$$
C(F_{0, T}^{P}(S), F_{0, T}^{P}(K), \sigma, T) = F_{0, T}^{P}(S)N(d_1) - F_{0, T}^{P}(K)N(d_2)
$$

## Put option price

$$
P(S, K, \sigma, r, T, \delta) = Ke^{-rT}N(-d_2) - Se^{-\delta T}N(-d_1)
$$

where

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln{S / K} + (r - \delta + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2)T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}, d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
$$

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln{[F_{0, T}^{P}(S) / F_{0, T}^{P}(K)]} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2 T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}, d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
$$

$$
F_{0, T}^{P}(S) = Se^{-\delta T}, F_{0, T}^{P}(K) = Ke^{-rT}
$$

## Assumptions

Assumptions about stock return distribution

- Continuously compounded returns on the stock are normally distributed and independent over time (no ‘jumps’)
- The volatility of continuously compounded returns is known and constant
- Future dividends are known, either as dollar amount or as a fixed dividend yield

Assumptions about the economic environment

- The risk-free rate is known and constant
- There are no transaction costs or taxes
- It is possible to short-sell costlessly and to borrow at the risk-free rate.

# Options on stocks with discrete dividends

The prepaid forward price for stock with discrete dividends is

$$
F_{0, T}^{P}(S) = S_0 - PV_{0, T}(Div)
$$

# Options on currencies (scope out)

The prepaid forward price for the currency is

$$
F_{0, T}^{P}(x) = x_0 e^{-r_fT}
$$

Where $x_0$ is domestic spot rate and $r_f$ is foreign interest rate

# Options on futures

The prepaid forward price for a futures contract is the PV of the future price. Therefore

$$
C(F, K, \sigma, r, T) = Fe^{-rT}N(d_1) - Ke^{-rT}N(d_2)
$$

where

$$
d_1 = \frac{\ln{[F / K]} + \frac{1}{2}\sigma^2T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}}, d_2 = d_1 - \sigma \sqrt{T}
$$

# Option Greeks

What happens to the option price when one and only one input changes?

- Delta ($\Delta$): change in option price when stock price increase by $1
- Gamma ($\Gamma$): change in delta when option price increases by $1
- Vega: change in option price when volatility increases by 1%
- Theta ($\theta$): change in option price when time to maturity decreases by 1 day
- Rho ($\rho$): change in option price when interest rate increases by 1%

Greek measures for portfolios

- The Greek measure of a portfolio is weighted average of Greeks of individual portfolio components

$$
\Delta_{portfolio} = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{\omega_i \Delta_i}
$$

## Option elasticity ($\Omega$)

$\Omega$ describes the risk of the option relative to the risk of the stock in percentage terms: If stock price (S) changes by 1%, what is the percent change in the value of the option (C)?

$$
\Omega \equiv \frac{\text{\% change in option price}}{\text{\% change in stock price}} = \frac{\frac{\epsilon \Delta}{C}}{\frac{\epsilon}{S}} = \frac{S\Delta}{C}
$$

![Untitled](./Untitled%209.png)

$$
\text{The volatility of an option}, \sigma_{option} = \sigma_{stock} \times |\Omega|
$$

$$
\text{The risk premium of an option}, \gamma - r = (\alpha - r) \times \Omega
$$

$$
\text{Sharpe ratio for call} = \frac{\Omega(\alpha - r)}{\Omega \sigma} = \frac{\alpha - r}{\sigma} = \text{Sharpe ratio for stock}
$$

- Where | . | is the absolute value, $\gamma$ is the expected return on option, $\alpha$ is the expected return on stock, and r is the risk-free rate.

# Implied volatility

Volatility is unobservable

Option prices, particularly for near-the-money options, can be quite sensitive to volatility.

One approach is to compute historical volatility using the history of returns.

A problem with historical volatility is that expected future volatility can be different from historical volatility. 

Alternatively, we can calculate implied volatility, which is the volatility that, when put into a pricing formula (typically Black-Scholes), yields the observed option price.

In practice implied volatilities of in-, at-, and out-of-the money options are generally different.

- A **volatility smile** refers to when volatility is symmetric, with volatility lowest for at-the-money options, and high for in-the-money and out-of-the-money options.
- A difference in volatilities between in-the-money and out-of-the-money options is referred to as a **volatility skew**.

Some practical uses of implied volatility include

- Use the implied volatility from an option with an observable price to calculate the price of another option on the same underlying asset
- Use implied volatility as a quick way to describe the level of options prices on a given underlying asset: you could quote option prices in terms of volatility, rather than as a dollar price.
- Checking the uniformity of implied volatilities across various options on the same underlying assets allows one to verify the validity of the pricing model in pricing those options.

# Perpetual American options (scope out)

Perpetual American options (options that never expire) are optimally exercised when the underlying asset over reaches the optimal exercise barrier ($H_c$ for a call and $H_p$ for a put)

For a perpetual call option the optimal exercise barrier and price are

$$
H_c = K(\frac{h_1}{h_1 - 1}), price = (H_c - K)(\frac{S}{H_c})^{h_1}
$$

For a perpetual put option the optimal exercise barrier and price are

$$
H_p = K(\frac{h_2}{h_2 - 1}), price = (K - H_p)(\frac{S}{H_p})^{h_2}
$$

where

$$
h_1 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{r - \delta}{\sigma^2} + \sqrt{(\frac{r - \delta}{\sigma^2} - \frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{2r}{\sigma^2}}
$$

$$
h_2 = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{r - \delta}{\sigma^2} - \sqrt{(\frac{r - \delta}{\sigma^2} - \frac{1}{2})^2 + \frac{2r}{\sigma^2}}
$$
