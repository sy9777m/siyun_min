![./Untitled%2010.png](./Untitled%2010.png)

## LOS 3.a: Explain why the GIPS standards were created, what parties the GIPS standards apply to, and who is served by the standards.

    - Representative accounts - showing a top-performing portfolio as representative of a firm's results.
    - Survivorship bias - excluding "weak performance" accounts that have been terminated.

- Firms may present periods of noncompliant performance immediately prior to the compliant performance history as long as no noncompliant performance is presented for any periods after January 1, 2000.
    - 1999.12.31까지만 non-GIPS data 사용가능
- Firms must specify which performance results are noncompliant and the ways in which such (noncompliant) performance does not comply with GIPS.

## LOS 4.c Explain how the GIPS standards are implemented in countries with existing standards for performance reporting and describe the appropriate response when the GIPS standards and local regulations conflict.
