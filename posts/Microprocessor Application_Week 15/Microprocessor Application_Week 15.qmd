# USB Device Basics

Universal Serial Bus (USB) connects between a computer and peripheral devices

- created to replace various slow buses (parallel, serial, and keyboard connections)
    - USB 2.0: up to 480Mb/s (35MB/s)
    - USB 3.0: up to 6Gb/s (625MB/s)

A USB device can never start sending data without first being asked by the host controller

Single-master implementation

- Host polls various devices
- A device can request a fixed bandwidth (for audio and video I/O)

Universal Serial Bus is a misnomerâ€¦

- actually a tree built out of point-to-point links
    - Links are four-wire cables (ground, power, and two signal wires)

## The protocol

USB protocol defines a set of standards that any device can follow

- no need to write a driver for a device that is in a predefined class and follows that standard,
- predefined classes: storage devices, keyboards, mice, joysticks, network devices, and modems
- no defined standard for video devices and USB-to-serial devices
    - A driver is needed for every device

## Driver types

Linux supports two types of USB drivers

- Drivers on a host system
    - control the USB devices that are plugged into it
- Drivers on a device (USB gadget drivers)
    - control how that single device looks to the host computer as a USB device
- some hardware devices can actually be both
    - called USB OTG (On The Go)
    - E.g. Android 3.0+, some printers

# USB overview

A USB device has one or more configurations

- E.g., power and bandwidth requirements

A configuration has one or more interfaces

- E.g., audio data, knobs for speakers

An interface has one or more settings

- Different quality of services
    - E.g., different frame sizes for digital cameras
- Also zero or more endpoints
    - E.g., bulk, interrupt endpoints

# Endpoints

The most basic form of USB communication is through an endpoint

- Unidirectional: Carries data in one direction
    - from the host to device (OUT endpoint)
    - from the device to the host (In endpoint)

Four endpoint types

- CONTROL
- INTERRUPT
- BULK
- ISOCHRONOUS
