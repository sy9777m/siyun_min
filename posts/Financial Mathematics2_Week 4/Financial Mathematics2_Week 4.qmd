# Week 4

# Basic insurance strategies

Options can be

- used to insure long positions (floors)
- used to insure short positions (caps)
- written against asset positions (selling insurance)

# Insuring a long position: floors

A put option is combined with a position in the underlying asset

Goal - to insure against a fall in the price of the underlying asset

Buying an asset and a put generates a position that looks like a call!

# Insuring a short position: Caps

A call option is combined with a position in the underlying asset

Goal - to insure against an increase in the price of the underlying asset (when one has a short position in that asset)

An insured short position looks like a put!

# Put-call parity

The net cost of buying the index using options must equal the net cost of buying the index using a forward contract

$$
P + S = C + X/(1 + r)^{T}
$$

$$
P + F/(1 + r)^{T} = C + X/(1 + r)^{T}
$$

This is one of the most important relationships in derivatives!
