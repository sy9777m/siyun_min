# Introduction

Basic derivatives contracts

- forward contracts
- call options
- put options

Types of positions

- long position
- short position

Graphical representation

- Payoff diagrams
- profit diagrams

# Forward contracts

Definition - a binding agreement (obligation) to buy/sell an underlying asset in the future, at a price set today.

Futures contracts are the same as forward in principle except for some institutional and pricing differences.

A forward contract specifies

- The features and quantity of the asset to be delivered
- The delivery logistics, such as time, date, and place
- The price the buyer will pay at the time of delivery

# The payoff on a forward contract

Payoff for a contract is its value at expiration

Payoff for

- long forward = spot price at expiration - forward price
- Short forward = forward price - spot price at expiration

# Additional considerations

Types of settlement

- Cash settlement - less costly and more practical
- Physical delivery - often avoided due to significant costs

Credit risk of the counter party

- Major issue for over-the-counter contracts
    - credit check, collateral, bank letter of credit
- less severe for exchange-traded contracts
    - exchange guarantees transactions, requires collateral

# Call options

A non-binding agreement (right but not an obligation) to buy an asset in the future, at a price set today

Preserve the upside potential, while at the same time eliminating the unpleasant downside (for the buyer)

The seller of a call option is obligated to deliver if asked.

# Definition and terminology

A call option gives the owner the right but not the obligation to buy the underlying asset at a predetermined price during a predetermined time period.

Strike (or exercise) price - the amount paid by the option buyer for the asset if he/she decides to exercise.

Exercise - the act of paying the strike price to buy the asset

Expiration - the date by which the option must be exercised or become worthless

Exercise styles - specifies when the option can be exercised

- European-style - can be exercised only at expiration date
- American-style - can be exercised at any time before expiration
- Bermudan-style - can be exercised during specific periods

# Payoff/profit of a purchased call

$$
Payoff = Max[0, \text{spot price at expiration - strike price}]
$$

$$
Profit = Payoff - \text{future value of option premium}
$$

# Payoff/profit of a written call

$$
Payoff = -Max[0, \text{spot price at expiration - strike price}]
$$

$$
Profit = Payoff + \text{future value of option premium}

# Put options

A put option gives the owner the right but not the obligation to sell the underlying asset at a predetermined price during a predetermined time period

The seller of a put option is obligated to buy if asked

Payoff/profit of a purchased (i.e., long) put

- $Payoff = Max[0, \text{strike price - spot price at expiration}]$
- $Profit = Payoff - \text{future value of option premium}$

Payoff/profit of a written (i.e., short) put

- $Payoff = -Max[0, \text{strike price - spot price at expiration}]$
- $Profit = Payoff + \text{future value of option premium}$
