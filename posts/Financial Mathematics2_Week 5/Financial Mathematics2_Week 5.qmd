# Week 5

# Put-call parity

The net cost of buying the index using options must equal the net cost of buying the index using a forward contract

$$
P + S = C + X/(1 + r)^{T}
$$

$$
P + F/(1 + r)^{T} = C + X/(1 + r)^{T}
$$

This is one of the most important relationships in derivatives!

# Selling insurance

For every insurance buyer there must be an insurance seller

Strategies used to sell insurance

- **Covered writing** (option overwriting or selling a covered call) is writing an option when there is a corresponding long position in the underlying asset is called covered writing.
- **Naked writing** is writing an option when the writer does not have a position in the asset.

# Covered writing: Covered calls

Writing a covered call generates the same profit as selling a put!

# Covered writing: Covered puts

Writing a covered put generates the same profit as writing a call!

# Synthetic forwards

A synthetic long forward contract

- buying a call and selling a put on the same underlying asset, with each option having the same strike price and time to expiration

Differences between a synthetic long forward contract and the actual forward

- The forward contract has a zero premium, while the synthetic forward requires that we pay the net option premium
- With the forward contract, we pay the forward price, while with the synthetic forward we pay the strike price.

# Spreads and collars

An option spread is a position consisting of only calls or only puts, in which some options are purchased and some written

- Examples: bull spread, bear spread, box spread

A collar is the purchase of a put option and the sale of a call option with a higher strike price, with both options having the same underlying asset and having the same expiration date

- Example: zero-cost collar

# Spreads

A **bull spread** is a position, in which you buy a call and sell an otherwise identical call with a higher strike price

- It is a bet that the price of the underlying asset will increase.
- Bull spreads can also be constructed using puts.

A **bear spread** is a position in which one sells a call and buys an otherwise identical call with a higher strike price.

A **box spread** is accomplished by using options to create a synthetic long forward at one price and a synthetic short forward at a different price.

- A box spread is a means of borrowing or lending money: it has no stock price risk.

A **ratio spread** is constructed by buying m calls at one strike and selling n calls at a different strike with all options having the same time to maturity and same underlying asset

- Ratio spreads can also be constructed using puts.

# Collars

A collar represents a bet that the price of the underlying asset will decrease and resembles a short forward

A zero-cost collar can be created when the premiums of the call and put exactly offset and another.

# Speculating on volatility

Options can be used to create positions that are nondirectional with respect to the underlying asset

Examples

- straddles
- strangles
- butterfly spreads

Who would use nondirectional positions?

- Investors who do not care whether the stock goes up or down, but only how much it moves, i.e., who speculate on volatility.

# Straddles

Buying a call and a put with the same strike price and time to expiration

![Untitled](./Untitled%205.png)

A straddle is a bet that volatility will be high relative to the market’s assessment.

# Written straddles

Selling a call and put with the same strike price and time to maturity

Unlike a purchased straddle, a written straddle is a bet that volatility will be low relative to the market’s assessment.

# Butterfly spreads

Write a straddle + add a strangle = insured written straddle

A butterfly spread insures against large losses on a straddle.
